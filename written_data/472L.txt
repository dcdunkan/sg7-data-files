worship Him (2)

So forget about yourself

and concentrate on Him and
worship Christ the Lord;
Worship Him, Jesus Christ
the Lord.

Let us lift up holy hands
and magnify His name and
worship Him (2)

Let us lift up holy hands
and magnify His name and
worship Christ the Lord;
Worship Him, Jesus Christ
the Lord.

Oh oh oh heaven is in my heart (2)

The kingdom of our God is here
Heaven is in my heart

The presence of His majesty
Heaven is in my heart

And in His presence joy abounds
Heaven is in my heart

The light of holiness surrounds
Heaven is in my heart.

His precious life on me He spent
Heaven is in my heart

To give me life without an end
Heaven is in my heart

In Christ is all my confidence
Heaven is in my heart

The hope of my inheritance
Heaven is in my heart.

We're a temple for His throne
Heaven is in my heart

And Christ is the foundation stone
Heaven is in my heart

He will return to take us home
Heaven is in my heart
