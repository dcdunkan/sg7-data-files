Al earthly gain | count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that | should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God,
All the vain things that charm me most,
| sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down:
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet;
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine.
Demands my heart, my life, my all!
e Isaac Watts

49











Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free,
Rolling as a mighty ocean

In its fullness over me.
Underneath me, all around me;
Is the current of Thy love;

Leading onward, leading homeward,
To my glorious rest above.

0, the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Spread His praise from shore to shore,
How He loveth, ever loveth,
Changeth never, never more;
How He watches o'er

His loved ones,

Died to call them all His own;
How for them He intercedeth,
Watcheth o'er them from the throne.

0, the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Love of every love the best;

'Tis an ocean vast of blessing,
'Tis a heaven sweet of rest.

O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
