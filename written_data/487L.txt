The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace.

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,

To spread thro’ all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name.

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;

'T's music in the sinner’s ears,
'T's life, and health, and peace.

He breaks the power of canceled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood availed for me.

Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy.

***  Charles Wesley

All the way my Saviour leads me:
What have | to ask beside?

Can | doubt His tender mercy,
Who thro’ life has been my Guide?
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell!

For | know whate'er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well; well

All the way my Saviour leads me:
Cheers each winding path | tread,
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the living bread.
Though my weary steps may falter,
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the rock before me,
Lo! a spring of joy | see; see.

All the way my Saviour leads me:
Oh, the fulness of His love!
