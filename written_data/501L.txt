Glory to His name , Glory to His name
Glory to His name

All may change but Jesus never,
Glory to His name

Thy loving kindness

Is better than life (2)

My lips shall praise Thee,
Thus will | bless Thee
Thy loving kindness

Is better than life.

I lift my hands up unto Thy name
My lips shall praise Thee
Thus will | bless Thee,
Thy loving kindness
Is better than life.

I have decided to follow Jesus (3)
No tuming back, no turning back! (2)

Though all may leave me,
still I will follow (3)
No tuming back, no turning back (2)

The cross before me,
the world behind me (3)
No tuming back, no turning back (2)

You take the whole world,
but give me Jesus (3)
No tuming back, no turning back (2)

Where the flowers are blooming
And the sweet waters flow;
