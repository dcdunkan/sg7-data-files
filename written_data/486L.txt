Lone and dreary, faint and weary,
Through the desert
Thou didst go.

Spirit of our God, descending,
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy;
Love with every passion blending,
Pleasure that can never cloy:
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy.

62











Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,
the King of creation!

O my soul, praise Him,

for He is thy health and salvation!
Come ye who hear,

Now to His great throne draw near;
Join me in glad adoration!

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all
things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under His wings,
yea, so gently sustaineth!

Hast thou not seen

All that is needful hath been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who doth
prosper thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and mercy
here daily attend thee,

Ponder anew what

the Almighty can do,

He who with love doth befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord,

Oh let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath,

Come now with praises before Him.
Let the Amen sound from

His people again,
