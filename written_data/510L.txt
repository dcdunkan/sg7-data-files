Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday dear..........
Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
God bless you and keep you
Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you,

Only one will not do,

Born again means salvation
How many have you?

Like a river, glorious

Is God's perfect peace,
Over all victorious

In its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it floweth
Fuller every day;
Perfect, yet it groweth
Deeper all the way.

Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow,
Never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry
Not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry,
Touch the spirit there.

Every joy or trial

Falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial

By the Son of Love.

We may trust Him fully

All for us to do;

They who trust Him wholly
