Loved with everlasting love,
Led by grace that love to know;
Gracious, spirit, from above,
Thou hast taught me it is so!
Oh, this full and perfect peace!
Oh, this transport all divine!

In a love which cannot cease,
| am His, and He is mine.

Heaven above is softer blue,
Earth around is sweeter green!
Something lives in every hue
Christless eyes have never seen:
Birds with gladder songs o'verflow,
Flow'rs with deeper

beauties shine,

Since | know, as now | know,

| am His, and He is mine.

Things that once were

wild alarms

Cannot now disturb my rest;
Closed in everlasting arms,
Pillowed on the loving breast.
Oh, to lie for ever here,

Doubt, and care, and self resign,
While He whispers in my ear,

| am His, and He is mine.

His for ever, only His;
Who the Lord and me shall part?
Ah, with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart!
Heaven and earth may fade, and flee,
First-born light in gloom decline;
But while God and | shall be,
| am His, and He is mine.

When | survey the wondrous cross,
On which the Lord of Glory died,
