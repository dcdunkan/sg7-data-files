Lord, please show me every day,
As You're teaching me Your way,
That You do just what You say

In Your time.

In Your time, In Your Time,
You make all things

beautiful in Your time

Lord my life to You | bring,
May each song | have to sing,
Be to you a lovely thing

In Your time.

It passeth knowledge,

that dear love of Thine,
Lord Jesus, Saviour;

yet this soul of mine

Would of Thy love,

in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth,

its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.

It passeth telling,

that dear love of Thine,

Lord Jesus, Saviour;

yet these lips of mine

Would fain proclaim to sinners,
far and near,

A love which can remove

all guilt and fear,

And love beget.

It passeth praises,

that dear love of Thine,

Lord Jesus, Saviour;

yet this heart of mine

Would sing that love,

so full, so rich, so free,
Which brings a rebel sinner,
even me,
