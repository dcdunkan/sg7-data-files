Praising my Saviour

all the day long

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour

all the day long..

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
lin my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting,

looking above,

Filled with His goodness,

lost in His love.

Day by day, and with

each passing moment,

Strength | find to meet

my trials here;

Trusting in my Father's

wise bestowment,

I've no cause for worry or for fear.
He whose heart is kind

beyond all measure,

Gives unto me each day

what he deems best,

Lovingly its part of pain

and pleasure,

Mingling toil with peace and rest.

Everyday the Lord Himself is near me,
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would

bear and cheer me,

He whose name is Counsellor
and Power

The protection of His child

and treasure
