Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng

Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph-song

Glory, laud and honour

Unto Christ the King

This through countless ages
Men and angels sing

162











Above all powers,
above all kings

Above all nature

And all created things
Above all wisdom

And all the ways of man
You were here

Before the world began

Above all kingdoms

Above all thrones

Above all wonders

The world has ever known
Above all wealth

And treasures of the earth
There's no way

To measure what You're worth

Crucified, laid behind a stone

You lived to die,

Rejected and alone

Like a rose,

Trampled on the ground

You took the fall

And thought of me (2)
Aboveall....

Come bless the Lord
All ye servants of the Lord,
