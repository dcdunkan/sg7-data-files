He will keep me lest | fall,
Oh, the best friend to have is Jesus.

The best thing to do is to trust Him;
The best thing to do is to trust Him;
And if you on Him depend,

He will keep you to the end;

Oh, the best thing to do is to trust Him.

Life is wonderful, oh so wonderful
Life is wonderful now to me;

| took Jesus in;

He changed everything:

Life is wonderful now.

Since His blessings

came into my heart,

Joy unspeakable fills my every part,
Now | want to live for my Lord;
Life is wonderful now.

121











Seek ye first the Kingdom of God,
And His righteousness,

And all these things shall

Be added unto you

Hallelu, Hallelujah “Hallelujah...”

Ask and it shall be given unto you,
Seek and ye shall find,

Knock and it shall

Be opened unto you

Hallelu, Hallelujah “Hallelujah...”

Man shall not live by bread alone

But by every word,

That proceeds from the

Mouth of God

Hallelu, Hallelujah “Hallelujah...”
