He's just the same unchanging Jesus,
Through eternity

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

Iâ€™m feeding on the living Bread
I'm drinking at the Fountain head
And who so drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.
What? Never thirst again?

No! Never thirst again.

What? never thirst again?

No! Never thirst again

And whoso drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

103











He's able, He's able,

I know He's able,

| know my Lord is able

to carry me through (2)

He heals the broken-hearted
And sets the captive free

He makes the lame to walk again
And cause the blind to see.
For He's able, He's able!
Praise God! He's able!

| know my Lord is able

To carry me through.

104











He lives! He lives!
Christ Jesus lives today!
He walks with me and
talks with me

Along life's narrow way.
