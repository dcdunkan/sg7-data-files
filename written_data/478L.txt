Praise Him, Praise Him
Praise the everlasting King!

Praise Him for His grace

and favour

To our fathers in distress;

Praise Him, still the same for ever,
Slow to chide and swift to bless,
Praise Him, Praise Him

Praise Him, Praise Him

Praise the everlasting King!

Father-like, He tends and spares us;
Well our feeble frame He knows,
In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes.
Praise Him, Praise Him

Praise Him, Praise Him

Widely as His mercy flow!

Angels, help us to adore Him,

Ye behold Him face to face;

Sun and moon bow down

before Him;

Dwellers all in time and space,

Praise Him, Praise Him

Praise Him, Praise Him

Praise with us the God of grace!
b Henry F. Lyte

Praise Him! praise Him!
Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Sing, O Earth, His wonderful
love proclaim!

Hail Him! hail Him!

highest archangels in glory;
Strength and honour give to
His holy name!

Like a shepherd, Jesus will
guard His children,

In His arms He carries them
all day long.
