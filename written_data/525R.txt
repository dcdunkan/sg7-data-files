In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that

beautiful shore;

In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that

beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that
beautiful shore
The melodious
songs of the blest;
And our spirits shall
sorrow no more,
Nota sigh for the blessing of rest.

(In the sweet...)
To our bountiful Father above,
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings
that hallow our days.

(In the sweet...)

Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Thou art worthy, O Lord.

To receive glory, glory and honor,
Glory and honor and power!

For Thou hast created,

Hast all things created,
Thou hast created all things;
And for Thy pleasure

they are created,

Thou art worthy, O Lord!

Through Thy precious body
broken

Inside the veil;

Oh! what words to sinners
