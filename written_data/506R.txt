With our hearts full of praise;
Be exalted, oh Lord, our God,
Hosanna in the highest!

Glory, Glory,
Glory to the King of kings! (2)
Lord, we lift up Your name
With our hearts full of praise;
Be exalted, oh Lord, our God,
Glory to the King of kings!

I can hear my Saviour calling,
| can hear my Saviour calling,
| can hear my Saviour calling
â€œTake thy cross and follow, follow Me"

Where He leads me | will follow
Where He leads me | will follow
Where He leads me | will follow
Il go with Him, with Him all the way.

He will give me grace and glory-3
And go with me, with me all the way.
I'll go with Him thru the garden-3

I'l go with Him, with Him all the way
I'll go with Him thru the judgement-3
I'll go with Him, with Him all the way

Majesty, worship His majesty!
Unto Jesus be all glory,

honour, and praise.

Majesty, kingdom authority

Flows from His throne, unto His own
His anthems raise.

So exalt, lift up on high
The name of Jesus
Magnify, come glorify
Christ Jesus the King.
