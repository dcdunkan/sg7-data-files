For this is the will of God (3)
In Christ Jesus concerning you.

Quench not the Spirit
For this is the will of God (3)
In Christ Jesus concerning you.

The steadfast love of the
Lord never ceases,
His mercies never come to an end
They are new every morning,
New every morning,
Great is Thy faithfulness, O Lord,
Great is Thy faithfulness.

Morning Star, Hope of the world,
Shine down in the glory of
heavenâ€™s light.

Morning star, Beacon of love,
Light our way to the full light of day.

Dispel the darkness of the night,
Reflecting God's enternal light;
And as the day dawns,

and your flame burns bright,
Morning star, arise in our hearts.

Father Abraham had many sons
Many sons had father Abraham
I'm one of them, and so are you
So let's just praise the Lord.

Right hand - Left hand

Right foot - Left foot

Nod your head - Turn around
Sit down
