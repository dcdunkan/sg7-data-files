The wise man built his house
upon the rock (3)

And the rain came tumbling down;
The rain came down

And the floods came up (3)

But the house on the rock stood firm.

The foolish man built his house

The rain came down

and the floods came up (3)

But the house on the sand fell down.

of Heaven.

Wonderful, wonderful,
Jesus is to me;

Counsellor, Prince of Peace,
Mighty God is He;

Saving me, keeping me,
From all sin and shame,
Wonderful is my Redeemer,
Praise His Name.
