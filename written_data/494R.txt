The joy | feel, the bliss | share,

Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for Thy return!
With such | hasten to the place
Where God, my Saviour, shows His face,
And gladly take my station there,
And wait for thee, sweet

hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer!
sweet hour of prayer,
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth
and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me
seek His face,
Believe His Word, and
trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet
hour of prayer.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
Ye soldiers of the Cross;

Lift high His royal banner,

It must not suffer loss:

From victory unto victory

His army shall He lead,

Till every foe is vanquished
And Christ is Lord indeed

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,

Ye soldiers of the Cross;

Lift high His royal banner,

It must not, it must not suffer loss.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
The trumpet call obey;

Forth to the mighty conflict,

In this His glorious day:
