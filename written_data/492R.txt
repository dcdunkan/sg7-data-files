For man, His creature’s sin.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love | owe;

Here, Lord, | give myself away
'Tis all that | can do.

Isaac Watts

79











Beneath the Cross of Jesus,
| fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty rock,
Within a weary land:

A home within the wilderness,
Arest upon the way,

From the burning

of the noon tide heat,

And the burden of the day.

Oh, safe and happy shelter,

Oh, refuge tried and sweet!

Oh, trusting place where heaven’s love

And heaven's justice meet!

As to the holy patriarch

That wondrous dream was given,
So seems my Saviour's Cross to me,
A ladder up to heaven.

Upon that Cross of Jesus,

Mine eye at times can see

The very dying form of One,

Who suffered there for me;

And from my smitten heart, with tears,
Two wonders | confess :

The wonders of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.

| take, O Cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;

I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
