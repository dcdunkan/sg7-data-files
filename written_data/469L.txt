Come for a cleasing to
Calvary's tide,

Thereâ€™s wonderful
power in the blood.

Would you be whiter,

much whiter than snow?

There's power in the blood,
Power in the blood;

Sin-stains are lost in its
Llife-giving flow;

There's wonderful power in the blood.

Would you do service for

Jesus your King?

There's power in the blood,

power in the blood;

Would you live daily

His praises to sing?

there's wonderful power in the blood.
***  Lewis E. Jones

Trying to walk in the

steps of the Saviour

Trying to follow our

Saviour and King

Shaping our lives by

His blessed example
Happy how happy the songs
that we bring

How beautiful to walk

in the steps of the Saviour
Stepping in the light,
stepping in the light

How beautiful to walk

in the steps of the Saviour
Led in Paths of light.

Pressing more closely to
Him who is leading
When we are tempted

to turn from the way
