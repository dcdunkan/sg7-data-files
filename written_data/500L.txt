He lives! He lives!

Salvation to impart!

You ask me how | know he lives?
He lives within my heart.

105











Oh, glory to God,

He has lifted me up,

He has lifted me up, | know.
He reached out His hands
And He lifted me up

And that's why | love Him so

I love Him more and more (2)
And when | stand upon the other shore,
I'll praise Him more and more.

Only a boy named David,
only a little sling,

Only a boy named David,
but he could pray and sing;
Only a boy named David,
only a rippling brook,

Only a boy named David,
but five little stones he took.

And one little stone went in the sling,
And the sling went round and round,
And round, and round,

and round, and round,

And round, and round, and round
And one little stone went up in the air
And the giant came tumbling down.

107











When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way!
