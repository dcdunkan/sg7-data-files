Early let us turn to Thee (2)

Early let us seek Thy favour;

Early let us do Thy will;

Blessed Lord and only Saviour,

With Thy love our bosoms fill:

Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,

Thou hast loved us, love us still (2)
***  Dorothy A. Thrupp

Tell me the old, old story
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love;
Tell me the story simply,
As to a little child,

For | am weak and weary,
And helpless and defiled

Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Tell me the old, old story,
Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story slowly,
That | may take it in -

That wonderful redemption,
God's remedy for sin;

Tell me the story often,

For | forget so soon;

The “early dew” of morning
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the story, softly,

With earnest tones and grave;
Remember I'm the sinner
Whom Jesus came to save;
Tell me that story always,

If you would really be,

In any time of trouble,

A comforter to me.

Tell me the same old story,
