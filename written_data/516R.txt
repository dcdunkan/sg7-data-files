And in Jesusâ€™ name | come to you
To share His power as
He told me to.

God will make a way,

Where there seems to be no way,
He works in ways we cannot see,
He will make a way for me

He will be my guide,

Hold me closely to His side,
With love and strength

for each new day,

He will make a way,

He will make a way.

By a road way in the wilderness,
He will lead me,

And rivers in the desert will | see,
Heaven and Earth will fade,

But His Word will still remain,
He will do something new today.
