True and tender, pure and precious,
Oh how blest to call Him mine!

All that thrills my soul is Jesus,
He is more than life to me;
And the fairest of ten thousand
In my blessed Lord | see

Love of Christ so freely given,
Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven,
Deeper than the deepest sea.

What a wonderful redemption!
Never can a mortal know

How my sin, tho’ red like crimson,
Can be whiter than the snow

Ev'ry need His hand supplying,
Ev'ry good in Him | see;

On His strength divine relying
He is all in all to me

By the crystal flowing river
With the ransomed | will sing,
And for ever and for ever
Praise and glorify the King.
e Thoro Harris
77











Abide with me - fast falls
the even tide,

The darkness deepen Lord,
with me abide;

When other helpers fail

and comforts flee,

Help of the helpless,

Oh abide with me!

Swift to its close ebbs out
life’s little day;

Earth's joys grow dim,

its glories pass away;
Change and decay in

all around | see
