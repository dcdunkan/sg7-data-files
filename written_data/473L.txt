All to Jesus | surrender,
Humbly at His feet | bow;
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me Jesus take me now

Al to Jesus | surrender
Lord, | give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.
e Judson W.

“There shall be showers of blessing”
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

Showers of blessing,

Showers of blessing we need,
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

“There shall be showers of blessing”
Precious reviving again;

Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

“There shall be showers of blessing”
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,
Come, and now honor Thy Word

“There shall be showers of blessing”
Oh, that today they might fall
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!

*** Daniel W. Whittle

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!

Heir of salvation, purchase of God:
Bom of His Spirit, washed in His blood,

This is my story, this is my song,
