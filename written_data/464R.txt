Are you washed in the
blood of the Lamb?

Do you rest each moment
in the Crucified?

Are you washed in the
blood of the Lamb?

When the Bridegroom cometh
will your robes be white?

Are you washed in the

blood of the Lamb?

Will your soul be ready for the
mansions bright

And be washed in the

blood of the Lamb.

Lay aside the garments
that are stained with sin
And be washed in the
blood of the Lamb;
There’s a fountain flowing
for the soul unclean,
Oh, Be washed in the
blood of the Lamb.
*** Elisha A Hoffman

5











Oh happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Saviour and my
God!

Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

Happy day, Happy day,

When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day,
Happy day, happy day,

When Jesus washed my sins away!
*Tis done, the great transactions done
| am my Lord’s, and He is mine;
He drew me and | followed on,
