Mortals, join the mighty chorus
Which the morning stars began;
Father love is reigning o'er us,
Brother love binds man to man.
Ever singing, march we onward,
Victors in the midst of strife;
Joyful music lifts us sunward

In the triumph song of life.

O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior,
And life more abundant and free!

Tum your eyes upon Jesus,

Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow
strangely dim

In the light of His glory and grace.

Thro' death into life everlasting

He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conqurors we are!

His word shall not fail you
He promised;
Believe Him, and all will be well:
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!

*** Helen H. Lemmel

I heard an old, old story,

how a saviour came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary
to save a wretch like me:

| heard about His groaning,

of His precious atoning,

Then | repented of my sins

and won the victory.

O victory in Jesus, my saviour, for ever!
