Far beyond this vale of tears,
| shall swell the song of worship
Through the everlasting years.

I am looking at the brightness -
See, it shineth from afar -

Of the clear and joyous beaming
Of the bright and morning Star,
Through the dark grey

mist of morning

Do | see its glorious light;

Then away with every shadow
Of this sad and weary night.

I am waiting for the coming

Of the Lord who died for me;

Oh, His words have

thrilled my spirit,

“I will come again for Thee.”

| can almost hear His footfall

On the threshold of the door,

And my heart, my heart is longing
To be with Him evermore.

I just keep trusting my Lord
As | walk along,

| just keep trusting my Lord,
And He gives me a song,
Though the storm clouds
darken the sky,

O'er the heavenly trail,

| just keep trusting my Lord,
He will never fail.

He's a faithful friend, -2
Such a faithful friend,-2

| can count on Him,-2

To the very end.-2
Though the storm clouds
darken the sky,

O'er the heavenly trail,
