When you have cause to fear

That this world's empty glory

Is costing me too dear.

Yes, and when that world’s glory

Is dawning on my soul,

Tell me the old, old story

“Christ Jesus makes thee whole.”
*** A. Catherine Hankey

Sing them over again to me,
Wonderful words of life;

Let me more of their beauty see,
Wonderful words of life.

Words of life and beauty,

Teach me faith and duty;

Beautiful words, wonderful words,
Wonderful words of life.

Christ, the blessed One, gives to all
Wonderful words of life;
Sinner, list to the loving call,
Wonderful words of life.
All so freely given,
Wooing us to heaven:
Sweetly echo the gospel call,
Wonderful words of life;
Offer pardon and peace to all,
Wonderful words of life.
Jesus only Saviour,
Sanctify for ever :

b Philip P. Bliss

Softly and tenderly

Jesus is calling,

Calling for you and for me;
See, on the portals He's
waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me!

Come home, come home,
