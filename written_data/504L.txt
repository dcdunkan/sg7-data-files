For the Lord he wanted to see,
And as the Saviour passed that way,
He looked up in the tree,

And He said, “Zaccheus, you
come down; For I'm coming to
your house today.”

'm H-A-P-P-Y, I'm H-A-P-P-Y
I know I'm, Am sure | am,

I'm H-A-P-P-Y,

I'm S-A-V-E-D, In J-E-S-U-S
Through His B-L-O-O-D

All ye saints adore Him
Praise Him praise Him
For He is on the

And glory be Thine,

And glory be Thine,
Blessing and honour

For Thou art on the throne.

Yours and Yours alone.
