And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Count... your blessings:
Name them one by one,
Count... your blessings:
See what God hath done;
Count... your blessings:
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Are you ever burdened

With a load of care?

Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Ev'ry doubt will fly

And you will be singing

As the days go by.

When you look at others with
Their lands and gold.

Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold;

Count your many blessings
Money cannot buy

Your reward in heaven,

Nor your home on high

So, amid the conflict,
Whether great or small,

Do not be discouraged,
God is over all;

Count your many blessings,
Angels will attend,

Help and comfort give you
To your journey’s end.

Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,
By His presence all divine?
