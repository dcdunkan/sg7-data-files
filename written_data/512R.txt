Who stand by night

In the house of the Lord,

Lift up your hands in the Holy place
And bless the Lord,

and bless the Lord.

Oh taste and see that
the Lord is good (3)
And bless the Lord
and bless the Lord.

He lifted me up,

From the miry clay,

And set my feet

On the rock to stay,

He put a song in my heart today
A song of praise,

a song of praise.

Father in heaven, how we love You,
We lift Your name in all the earth.
May Your Kingdom be
established in our praises,
As Your people declare
Your mighty works.
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty,
Who was and is and is to come;
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
Who reigns for evermore.

Rejoice evermore
For this is the will of God (3)
In Christ Jesus concerning you.

Pray without ceasing
For this is the will of God (3)
In Christ Jesus concerning you.

In everything give thanks
