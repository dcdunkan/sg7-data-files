While we do His good will
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

Tust and obey,

For thereâ€™s no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,

Not a cloud in the skies,

But His smile quickly

drives it away;

Not a doubt nor a fear,

Not a sigh nor a tear,

Can abide while we trust and obey.

But we never can prove,

The delights of His love,

Until all on the alter we lay;

For the favour He shows,

And the joy He bestows,

Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet,
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by
His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go -
Never fear only trust and obey.
***  John H. Sammis

A sunbeam, a sunbeam,

Jesus wants me for a sunbeam;
A sunbeam, a sunbeam,

I'll be a sunbeam for Him.

Yesterday, today, forever
Jesus is the same
All may change, but Jesus never,
