According to Thy gracious word,
In meek humility.

This will | do, O Christ my Lord,
I will remember Thee.

Thy body, broken for my sake,
My bread from heaven shall be;
Thy testamental cup | take,
And thus remember Thee.

Gethsemane can | forget?

Or there Thy conflict see,

Thine agony and blood-like sweat,
And not remember Thee?

When to the cross

| turn mine eyes

And rest on Calvary,

O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,
| must remember Thee.

Remember Thee,

and all Thy pains,
And all Thy love to me;
Yea, while a breath,

a pulse remains,

I will remember Thee.

An! Lord God,

Thou hast made the heavens,
And the earth by Thy great power.
Ah! Lord God,

Thou hast made the heavens,
And the earth by Thine
outstretched arm.

Nothing is too difficult for Thee(2)
O great and mighty God,

Great in counsel and

mighty in deed,

Nothing, nothing,
