Flow, river, flow,

Flood the nations with grace
and mercy;

Send forth Your Word,

Lord, and let there be light.

Lord, | come to Your
awesome presence,

From the shadows

into your radiance;

By the blood | may

enter Your brightness,
Search me, try me,
consume all my darkness,
Shine on me, shine on me.

As we gaze on Your kingly
brightness,
So our faces display
Your likeness;
Ever changing from glory to glory,
Mirror'd here may our lives
tell Your story,
Shine on me, shine on me.

“Man of Sorrows,” what a name
For the Son of God who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim!
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood;
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Guilty, vile and helpless we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
“Full atonement” can it be?
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
Lifted up was He to die,

“It is finished,” was His cry;
Now in heaven exalted high,
