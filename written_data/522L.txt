Thyself to be taken,

Led by Thy creatures and
nailed to the cross!

Hated of men, and of God,\
too forsaken,

Shunning not darkness,
the curse, and the loss!

How hast Thou triumphed,
and triumphed with glory,
Battled death'’s forces,
rolled back every wave!
Can we refrain, then,

from telling the story?
Lord, Thou art Victor o'er
death and the grave.

Keep me true, Lord Jesus,
Keep me true -2

There’s a race that | must run,
There are victories to be won,
Give me power every hour

to be true.

Light of the world you stepped
down into darkness,

Opened my eyes, Let me see,
Beauty that made

this heart adore You,

Hope of a life spent with You.

Here | am to worship,

Here | am to bow down,
Here | am to say that
you're my God,

You're altogether lovely,
Altogether worthy,
Altogether wonderful to me.
