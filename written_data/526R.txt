knows no measure
Outside the camp.

Soon Thy saints

shall all be gathered
Inside the veil;

All at home,

no more be scattered,
Inside the veil.
Nought from Thee,
our hearts shall sever;
We shall see Thee;
grieve Thee never;
“Praise the Lamb!”
shall sound forever
Inside the veil

216











To Calvary, Lord, in spirit now,
Our weary souls repair,

To dwell upon Thy dying love,
And taste its sweetness there.

Sweetresting place of every heart,

That feels the plague of sin,
Yetknows the deep, mysterious joy
Of peace with God within.

There, through Thine hour of
deepest woe,

Thy suffering spirit passed;
Grace there its wondrous
victory gained,

And love endured its last.

O Lamb of God!

Thy bleeding wounds,

With cords of love divine,
Have drawn

our willing hearts to Thee,
And linked our life with Thine.

Ourlonging eyes would fain behold
