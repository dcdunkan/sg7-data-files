When our weeping'’s over, He will
bid us welcome,

We shall come rejoicing, bringing
in the sheaves!

Thank You Jesus - 2
Thank You Lord, for loving me,
Thank You Jesus - 2
Thank You Lord, for loving me.

You went to Calvary,
And there You died for me,
Thank You, Lord, for loving me -2

You rose up from the grave,

To me new life You gave,

Thank You, Lord, for loving me -2

The sands of time are sinking,
the dawn of Heaven breaks;

The summer morn I've sighed
for—the fair, sweet morn awakes:
Dark, dark hath been the
midnight, but dayspring is at
hand,

And glory, glory dwelleth in
Immanuel’s land.

O Christ, He is the fountain, the
deep, sweet well of love!

The streams of earth I've tasted,
more deep I'll drink above:
There, to an ocean fullness, His
mercy doth expand,

And glory, glory dwelleth in
Immanuel’s land.

Oh | am my Beloved's, and my
Beloved’s mine!
