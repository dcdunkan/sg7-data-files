God of wisdom, love and might,
Foes may hate, and friends
may shun me,

Show Thy face, and all is bright.

Man may trouble and distress me,
"T'll but drive me to Thy breast;

Life with trials hard may press me;
Heaven will bring me sweeter rest.

Oh 't's not in grief to harm me,
While Thy love is left to me;

Oh 'tere not in joy to charm me,
Were that joy unmixed with Thee.

Haste thee on from grace to glory,
Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
Heaven's eternal dayâ€™s before thee,
God's own hand shall guide thee there.

Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,
Hope shall change to glad fruition,
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.
i Henry F. Lyte

69











I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,
Or to defend His cause,

Maintain the honour of his word,
The glory of His Cross.

At the Cross! at the Cross!
Where | first saw the light,

And the burden of My heart
rolled away;

It was there by faith

| received my sight,

And now | am happy all the day!

Jesus, my God! | know His name,
His name is all my trust;
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne His promise stands,
