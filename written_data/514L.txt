173

Sing a joyful song unto the Lord,
Praise the Lord with gladness,
Sing a joyful song unto the Lord
For He alone is God (2)

Praise Him!

Praise the Lord with gladness
Praise Him!

For He alone is God

174

He is Lord, He is Lord

He has risen from the dead
And He is Lord

Every knee shall bow

Every tongue confess

That Jesus Christ is Lord (2)

175

You are my strength

when | am weak

You are the treasure that | seek,
You are my all in all.

Seeking You,

as a precious jewel;

Lord to give up I'd be a fool,
You are my all in all.

Jesus, Lamb of God
Worthy is Your name (2)

Taking my sin, my cross,

my shame;

Rising again I'll bless Your
name,

You are my all in all.

When | fall down You pick me up;
When | am dry You fill my cup,
You are my all in all.
