All my trust on Thee is stay'd
All my help from Thee | bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, O Christ, art all | want,
More than all in Thee | find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,

| am all unrighteousness;
False, and full of sin | am,

Thou art full of truth and grace.

Plenteous grace with

Thee is found,

Grace to cover all my sin;

Let the healing streams abound.
Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art -
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.

Fairest of all the earth beside,
Chiefest of all unto Thy bride,
Fullness divine in Thee | see,
Beautiful man of Calvary!

Charles Wesley

That man of Calvary

Has won my heart from me
And died to set me free,
Blest man of Calvary!

Granting the sinner life and peace,
Granting the captive sweet release,
Shedding His blood

to make us free,

Merciful man of Calvary!

Giving the gifts obtained for men,
Pouring out love beyond our ken,
