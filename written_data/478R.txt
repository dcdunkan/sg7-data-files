Praise Him! Praise Him!

tell of His excellent greatness;
Praise Him! Praise Him!

ever in joyful song!

Praise Him! praise Him!
Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
For our sins He suffered,
and bled and died;

He, our Rock, our hope of
eternal salvation,

Hail Him! hail Him!

Jesus the Crucified.

Sound His praises! Jesus
who bore our sorrows;
Love unbounded, wonderful
deep and strong.

Praise Him! praise Him!
Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Heavenly portals
loud with hosannas ring!
Jesus, Saviour, reigneth
for ever and ever;
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Prophet and Priest and King!
Christ is coming over the world
victorious, Power and glory
unto the Lord belong.

To God be the glory,

great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that
He gave us His Son,

Who vyielded His life an
atonement for sin,

And opened the Life-gate
that all may go in.

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
