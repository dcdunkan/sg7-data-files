parenthood,

And your loving care,

But now | am Your child,

| am adopted in Your family,
And | will never be alone,
Cause Father God,

You're there beside me.

| will sing your praises - 3
Forevermore â€” 2

Jesus, | adore You....

For I'm building a people of power
And I'm making a people of praise
That will move through this land
by My Spirit,
And will glorify My precious name
Build Your church, Lord,
Make us strong, Lord,
Join our hearts, Lord,
through Your Son.
Make us one, Lord, In Your Body
In the kingdom of Your Son

For me to live is Christ,
to die is gain

To hold His hand and
walk His narrow way,
There is no peace,

no joy, no thrill,
