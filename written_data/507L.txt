Majesty, worship His majesty,
Jesus, who died, now glorified,
King of all kings.

What a fellowship what a joy divine
Leaning on the everlasting arms.
What a blessedness,
what a peace is mine
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Â©Oh how sweet to walk

in this pilgrim way

Leaning on the everlasting arms;
Oh, how bright the path grows
from day to day

Leaning on the everlasting arms.

What have | to dread,

what have | to fear

Leaning on the everlasting arms;

| have blessed peace

with my Lord so near,

Leaning on the everlasting arms.
*** Elisha A. Hoffman

Bind us together, Lord,
Bind us together with cords
that cannot be broken,

Bind us together, Lord,
Bind us together, Lord,
Bind us together, in love

There is only one God,
There is only one King;
There is only one body,
That is why we sing.
