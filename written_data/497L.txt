Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all | need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, | come! | come!

Just as | am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon,

cleanse, relieve,

Because Thy promise | believe,
O Lamb of God, | come! | come!

Just as | am, Thy love unknown
Hath broken every barrier down;
Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, | come! | come!
***  Charlotte Elliott

Out of my bondage,

sorrow, and night,

Jesus, | come; Jesus, | come;
Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light,
Jesus, | come to Thee;

Out of my sickness into Thy health,
Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
Out of my sin and into Thyself,
Jesus, | come to Thee.

Out of my shameful

failure and loss;

Jesus, | come; Jesus, | come;
Into the glorious gain of Thy Cross,
Jesus, | come to Thee;

Out of earth’s sorrows into Thy balm,
Out of life’s storm and into Thy calm,
Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
Jesus, | come to Thee.

Out of unrest and arrogant pride,
Jesus, | come; Jesus, | come;
Into Thy blessed will to abide,
Jesus, | come to Thee;

Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,
Out of despair into raptures above
