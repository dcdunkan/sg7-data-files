Holy Spirit,
what a comfort You are.

188











Here, O my Lord,

| see Thee face to face;
Here would | touch and
handle things unseen;
Here grasp with firmer hand
the eternal grace,

And all my weariness

upon Thee lean.

Here would | feed upon the
bread of God;

Here drink with Thee the
royal wine of heaven;

Here would | lay aside
each earthly load;

Here taste afresh

the calm of sin forgiven.

This is the hour of banquet

and of song;

This is the heavenly table
spread for me

Here let me feast, and, feasting,
still prolong

The brief bright

hour of fellowship with Thee

I have no help but Thine;
not do | need

Another arm save

Thine to lean upon;

It is enough, my Lord,
enough indeed;

My strength is in Thy might,
Thy might alone.

Mine is the sin,

but Thine the righteousness;
Mine is the guilt,
