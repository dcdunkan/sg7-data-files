Jesus has conquered sin and death

Jesus is seated on the throne (2)
Jesus is seated, Jesus is seated
Jesus is seated on the throne

Jesus is Lord of heaven and earth (2)
Jesus is Lord of, Jesus is Lord of
Jesus is Lord of heaven and earth

Jesus is living in His Church (2)
Jesus is living, Jesus is living
Jesus is living in His Church

Jesus is coming back again (2)
Jesus is coming, Jesus is coming
Jesus is coming back again

Open our eyes, Lord,

We want to see Jesus,

To reach out and touch Him,
And say that we love Him.

Open our ears Lord,
And help us to listen,
Open our eyes Lord,
We want to see Jesus.

Open our heart Lord,

That we might receive You
Open our spirits, And teach
us to worship.

Open our lips Lord,
And teach us to praise You,
Open our eyes Lord,
We want to see Jesus.

We are here to praise You,
Lift our hearts and sing,
We are here to give You,
The best that we can bring,
