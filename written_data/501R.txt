Everywhere He leads me
1 would follow, follow on,

Walking in His footsteps
Till the crown be won.

Follow, follow, | would follow Jesus,
Anywhere, everywhere,

1 would follow on:

Follow, follow, | would follow Jesus,
Everywhere He leads me,

1 would follow on!

Down in the valley with

My Saviour | would go,

Where the storns are sweeping
And the dark waters flow;

With His hand to lead me

I will never, never fear:

Dangers cannot fright me

If my Lord is near.

Down in the valley,

Or upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Saviour,
Would my soul ever keep;
He will lead me safely,

In the path that He has trod,
Upto where they gather

On the hills of God.

Living, He loved me;

Dying, He saved me;

Buried, He carried my sins far away
Rising, He justified freely for ever;
One day He's coming -

Oh glorious day!

114











I will make you fishers of men,
Fishers of men, fishers of men,
