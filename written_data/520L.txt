I'll stand.

In God's green pastures feeding,
by His cool waters lie,

Soft in the evening,

walk my Lord and I,

Al the sheep of His pasture fare
so wondrously fine;

His sheep am I.

Waters cool in the valley,
Pastures green on the mountain,
In the evening, In the evening
Walk my Lord and I.

Dark the night in the valley,
Rough the way on the mountain,
Step by step my Lord and | (2)

In God's great love rejoicing by
His grace and His power,
Great is the love-walk

with my Lord and I.

All my life | will love and

serve Him down here below.
His child am 1.

In God's wide world to preach
the Gospel of His grace,

Strong in the power of

His spirit divine,

All the ends of the earth

shall hear and trust in His name,
Hallelujah!

In His time, In His Time
He makes all things beautiful,
in His time.
