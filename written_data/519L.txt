I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as | onward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on

higher ground.”

Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith on heaven's tableland;
A higher plane than | have found
Lord, plant my feet on

higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and
fears dismay;

Tho' some may dwell where
these abound,

My prayer, my aim,

is higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Tho' Satan’s darts

at me are hurled;

For faith has caught

the joyful sound,

The song of saints

on higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till rest I've found,
“Lord, lead me
on to higher ground.”

In Christ alone
my hope is found
