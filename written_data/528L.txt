Too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an awesome God

Wonderful and Marvelous
is Jesus to me,

Sweeter than the honey,
in the honeycomb is He,

Jesus is real, He'll never fail;
1 will serve him now and
throughout all eternity.

He is always with me as I'm
walking along,

| can hear a melody - He's given
me a song
