Long to dwell with Thee above;
And to know, in full communion
All the sweetness of Thy love:
Come, Lord Jesus!

Take Thy waiting people home,
Come, Lord Jesus!

Take Thy waiting people home.

*** William Williams

How | praise Thee, precious Saviour,
That Thy love laid hold of me;
Thou hast saved and cleansed
and filled me,

That | might Thy channel be.

Channels only, blessed Master,
But with all Thy wondrous pow’r
Flowing thro’ us, Thou canst use us
Ev'ry day and ev'ry hour

Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me,
A clean vessel in Thy hand;

With no power but as Thou givest
Graciously with each command.

Witnessing Thy pow'r to save me,
Setting free from self and sin;
Thou who boughtest to possess me,
In Thy fulness, Lord, come in.

Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit
Hearts that full surrender know;
That the streams of living water
From our inner man may flow.

b Mary E. Maxwell

When upon life’s billows
You are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged,
Thinking all is lost,

Count your many blessings,
Name them one by one,
