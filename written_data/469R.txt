Trusting the arm that
strong to defend us,
Happy, how happy,
our praises each day,

Walking in footsteps of
gentle forbearance
Footsteps of faithfulness
mercy and love

Looking to Him for the
grace freely promised
Happy how happy our
journey above.

Trying to walk in the
steps of the Saviour
Upward still upward we'll
follow our Guide,

When we shall see Him,
the King in His beauty
Happy how happy

our place at His side

More about Jesus would | know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.

More, more about Jesus,

More, more about Jesus,

More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus, in His word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in ev'ry line,
Making each faithful saying mine.
