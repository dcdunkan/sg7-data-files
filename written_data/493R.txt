Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than
Thy blest name,

O Saviour of mankind!

Oh hope of every contrite heart,
Oh joy of all the meek

To those who fall,

how kind Thou art;

How good to those who seek!

But what to those who find?

Ah! this nor tongue,

nor pen can show, The love of Jesus!
what it is None but His

loved ones know

Saviour, our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our crown shalt be;
Be Thou, O Lord, our glory now,
And through eternity.
*** Bernard of Clairvaux

I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like
Thine Can peace afford.

I need Thee, O | need Thee,
Every hour | need Thee,

Oh bless me now, my Saviour,
I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour,

Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

I need Thee every hour,

In joy or pain;

Come quickly and abide,

Or life is vain.

I need Thee every hour,
