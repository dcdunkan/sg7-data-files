He sought me and brought
with His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere | knew Him,
and all my love is due Him
He plunged me to victory
beneath the cleansing blood.

I heard about His healing,

of His cleansing pow'r revealing,
How He made the lame to walk
again and caused the blind to see;
And then | cried, “Dear Jesus,
come and heal my broken spirit”
And somehow Jesus came and
brought to me the victory... O victory

I heard about a mansion

He has built for me in glory,

And | heard about the streets of
gold beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing and
the old redemption story,

And some sweet day I'll sing up
there the song of victory... O victory

Oh what a wonderful, wonderful day,
Day | will never forget;

After I'd wandered in darkness away,
Jesus my Saviour | met.

Oh what a tender

compassionate friend!

He met the need of my heart;
Shadows dispelling, With joy

| am telling,

He made all the darkness depart!

Heaven came down and

glory filled my soul,
When at the cross the
Saviour made me whole;
