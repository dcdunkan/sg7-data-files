Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
Jesus, | come to Thee.

Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, | come; Jesus, | come;
Into the joy and light of Thy home,
Jesus, | come to Thee;
Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, | come to Thee.

*** William T. Sleeper

Give me oil in my lamp,

Keep me burning,

Give me oil in my lamp, | pray
Give me oil in my lamp,

Keep me burning

Keep me burning till the break of day.

Sing Hosanna, sing Hosanna,
Sing Hosanna, to the King of kings.
Sing Hosanna, sing Hosanna,
Sing Hosanna, to the King!

Make me a fisher of men

keep me seeking

Make me a fisher of men, | pray,
Make me a fisher of men

keep me seeking,

Seeking souls fill Jesus comes again.

Give me joy in my heart,

keep me praising,

Give me joy in my heart, | pray;
Give me joy in my hart,

keep me praising,

Keep me praising fill the break of day.
Give me peace in my heart,

keep me resting...

Give me peace in my heart, | pray
Give me peace in my heart,
