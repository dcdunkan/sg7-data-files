Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Now rest my long divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;
Nor ever from Thy Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed.

High heaven heard that solemn vow

That vow renewed shall daily hear,

Till in life's latest hour | bow,

And bless in death a bond so dear.
***  Philip Doddridge

Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee;

Eâ€™en though it be a cross
That raiseth me,

Still all my

song shall be,

Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee.

Though, like a wanderer,
The sun gone down;
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone;

Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee.

There let my way appear,
Steps unto heaven;

All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy given;

Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee.

Then with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
