The wonders of Your mighty love,

My comfort, my shelter,

Tower of refuge and strength,
Let every breath, all that | am,
Never cease to worship You.

Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let
us sing,
Power and majesty,
praise to the King,
Mountains bow down and the
seas will roar,
At the sound of your name!
| sing for joy,
at the work of your hands,
Forever | love you,
forever I'll stand,
Nothing compares to the
promise | have in You.

Some day the silver cord

will break;

And | no more as

now shall sing;

But, Oh, the joy

when | shall wake

Within the palace of the King!

And | shall see...
Him face to face...
And tell the story,

saved by grace!

Some day my earthly house
will fall,

I cannot tell how soon 'twill be;
But this | knowâ€”my All in all
Has now a place in

heaven for me.

Some day when fades
