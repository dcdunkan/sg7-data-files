And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather
to their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder;
I'll be there.

Let us labour for the Master from
the dawn till setting sun
Let us talk of all His
Wondrous love and care,
Then when all of life is over,
and Our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.
***  James M. Black

11

Joy to the world!

The Lord is come;

Let earth receive her King;

Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heav'n and nature sing,

And heaven and heaven

and nature sing.

Joy to the earth!

The Saviour reigns;

Let men, their songs employ;
While fields and floods,

Rocks, hills and plains,

Repeat the sounding joy (2)
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;

He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found (2)

Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love (2)
