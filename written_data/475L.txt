Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Stream of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me, Lord, some

rapturous measure,

Meet for blood bought hosts above;
While | sing the countless treasure
Of my God'’s unchanging love.

Oh to grace how great a debtor,
Daily I'm constrained to be!

Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
Prone to wander, Lord, | feel it;
Prone to leave the God | love;

YYet Thou, Lord, hast deigned to seal it;
With Thy Spirit from above,

Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to save my soul from danger,
Inter-posed His precious blood,
Rescued thus from sin and danger,
Purchased by the Saviour's blood,
May | walk on earth a stranger,
As a son and heir of God.

Lord, the light of Your love is shining,
In the midst of the darkness shining;
Jesus, light of the world,

shine upon us;

Set us free by the truth

‘You now bring us,

Shine on me, shine on me.

Shine, Jesus, shine,

Fill this land with the father's glory;
Blaze, spirit, blaze,

Set our hearts on fire.
