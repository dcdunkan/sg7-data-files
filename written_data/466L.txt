Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
*** Augustus M. Toplady

There is a fountain fill'd with blood,
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And ssinners plunged beneath that blood
Loose all their guilty stains. (3)
And ssinners plunged beneath that blood

E’er since by faith | saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till | die (3)
Redeeming love has been my theme,

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;

And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away (3)

And there may I, though vile as he,

Dear dying Lamb! Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power, Till all
the ransomed Church of God

Be saved to sin no more (3)

Till all the ransomed Church of God

Then, in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save
When this poor lisping,
stam’ering tongue

Lies silent in the grave (3)
When this poor lisping,
stam’ering tongue

W. Cowper

What a Friend we have in Jesus,

All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
