That bright and blessed brow,
Once wrung with bitterest
anguish, wear

Its crown of glory now.

Thy sympathies and hopes are ours:

We long, O lord, to see

Creation all below, above,

Redeemed and blest by Thee.
*** Sir Edward Denny

We are gathering
together unto him.
We are gathering
together unto him.
Unto him shall the
gath'ring of the people be,
We are gathering
together unto him.
We are singing
together unto him...
We are praying
together unto him...
We are praising
together unto him...

218











We believe in God, the Father
Maker of the universe,

And in Christ, the Son,

our Saviour,

Come to us by virgin birth,

We believe He died to save us,
Bore our sins, was crucified;
Then from death,

He rose victorious,

Ascended to the Father's side.

Jesus, Lord of all.. Lord of all (4)
