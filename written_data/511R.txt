as onward | go
Since Jesus came into my heart!
*** Rufus H. McDaniel

Onward Christian soldiers
Marching as to war

With the cross of Jesus
Going on before

Christ, the Royal Master
Leads against the foe
Forward into battle

See His banner go

Oward Christian soldiers
Marching as to war

With the cross of Jesus
Going on before (2)

At the name of Jesus
Satan’s host doth flee

On then Christian soldiers
On to victory!

Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise
Brothers, lift your voices
Loud your anthems raise

Like a mighty army

Moves the Church of God
Brothers, we are treading

Where the saints have trod

We are not divided, All one body we
One in hope and doctrine

One in charity

Crowns and thrones may perish
Kingdoms rise and wane

But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain

Gates of hell can never

‘Gainst that Church prevail

We have Christ's own promise
And that cannot fail
