Dear Name! the rock on
which we build,

Our shield and hiding-place;
Our never-failing treasury,
filled With boundless

stores of grace.

Jesus! our Saviour,

Shepherd, Friend;

Our Prophet, Priest, and King;
Our Lord, our Life,our Way, our End;
Accept the praise we bring.

Weak is the effort of our heart,
And cold our warmest thought;
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
We'll praise Thee as we ought.

Till then, we would Thy love proclaim

With every fleeting breath;

And triumph, that blessed name

Which quells the pow'r of death.
***  John Newton

On a hill far away,

stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering
and shame

And | love that old cross,
Where the dearest and blest
For a world of lost sinners
was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
1 will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day

for a crown.

O that old rugged cross,

So despised by the world,

Has a wondrous attraction for me
For the dear Lamb of God,
