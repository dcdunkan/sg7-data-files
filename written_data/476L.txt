Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

When He comes,
our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then a new this song we'll sing:
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

b Philip P. Bliss

Behold! behold the Lamb of God,
On the cross!, On the Cross!

For us He shed His

precious blood,

On the Cross! On the cross!

O hear His all important cry,

“Eli lama sabachthani?”

Draw near and see the Saviour
die On the cross! On the cross!

Behold His arms extended wide,
On the cross! on the Cross!
Behold His bleeding hands and side,
On the Cross! On the cross!

The sun withholds its rays of light,
The heav'ns are clothed in
shades of night,

While Jesus winds the glorious fight,
On the Cross! On the cross!

By faith we see Him lifted up,

On the Cross! On the cross!

He drinks for us the bitter cup,
On the Cross! On the cross!

The rocks do rend, the moutains quake,
While Jesus doth

atonement make,

While Jesus suffers for our sake,
On the Cross! On the cross!

And now the mighty

deed is done,

On the cross! On the cross!
The battle for the vict'ry won,
