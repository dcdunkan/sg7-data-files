O how the world to evil allures me!
O how my heart is tempted to sin!

Over the world the vict'ry

Fairest Lord Jesus!

Ruler of all nature!

O Thou of God and man the Son!
Thee will | cherish,

Thee will | honor,

Thou my soul's glory, joy and crown!

Fair are the meadows,

Fairer still the woodlands,

Robed in the blooming garb of spring:
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

Fair is the sun shine,

Fairer still the moon light,

And all the twinkling starry host:
Jesus shines brighter,

Jesus shines purer

Than all the angels heav'n can boast.

Beautiful Saviour! Lord of the nations!
Son of God and Son of man!
Glory and honour,

praise, adoration

Now and for evermore be Thine!

Let us sing of His love once again,
Of the love that can never decay,

Of the blood of the Lamb who was slain,
Till we praise Him again in that day.

In the swee
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
