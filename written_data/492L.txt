Oh Thou who changest not,
abide with me!

I need Thy presence every
passing hour -

What but Thy grace can foil the
tempter's power?

Who like Thyself my guide
and stay can be?

Through cloud and sunshine,
Oh abide with me!

Hold Thou Thy Word before
my closing eyes,
Shine through the gloom, and
point me to the skies;
Heaven's morning breaks,
and earthâ€™s vain shadows flee -
In life, in death, O Lord,
abide with me!
***  Henny F. Lyte

Alas, and did my Saviour bleed?
And did my Sov'reign die?

Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as 1?

At the cross, at the cross

Where | first saw the light,

And the burden of my heart
rolled away,

It was there by faith

| received my sight,

And now | am happy all the day!

Was it for crimes that | have done
He groaned up on the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut his glories in,
When Christ the mighty Maker died
