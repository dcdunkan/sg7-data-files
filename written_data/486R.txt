Gladly for aye we adore Him.
*** Joachim Neander

63











Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible

hid from our eyes,

Most blessed, most glorious,

the Ancient of Days,

Almighty, victorious,

Thy great Name we praise.

Unresting, unhasting,

and silent as light,

Nor wanting, nor wasting,
Thou rulest in might;

Thy justice like mountains
high soaring above,

Thy clouds which are fountains
of goodness and love.

To all, life Thou givest -

to both great and small;

In all life Thou livest,

the true life of all;

We blossom and flourish
as leaves on the tree,

And wither and perish -
but naught changeth Thee.

Great Father of Glory,
pure Father of Light,
Thine angels adore Thee,
all veiling their sight;
All praise we would render:
Oh, help us to see
'Tis only the splendour
of light hideth Thee.
*** Walter C. Smith

Oh for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemerâ€™s praise,
