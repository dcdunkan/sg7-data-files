Most Holy One,
Oh make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son!

Jesus, keep me near the cross;
There a precious fountain,

Free to all, a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry’'s mountain,

In the Cross, in the Cross,

Be my glory ever;

Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.

Near the Cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;

There the bright and morning star
Shed its beams around me.

Near the Cross, O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadow o’er me.

Near the Cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,

Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.

Sweet hour of prayer!

sweet hour of prayer,

That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne,
Make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer!
Sweet hour of prayer,
