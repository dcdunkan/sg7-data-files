that the Lord has made,
1 will rejoice for He has made me glad‚Äù.

He has made me glad,
He has made me glad
1 will rejoice
for He has made me glad.

We worship and adore you
Bowing down before you,
Songs of praises singing,
Hallelujahs ringing
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen.

The joy of the Lord is my strength
If you want joy you must sing for it,
If you want joy you must clap for it,
If you want joy you must shout for it,
Oh! the joy of the Lord is my strength

Beautiful, beautiful,
Jesus is beautiful;
And Jesus makes
Beautiful things of my life.
Carefully touching me
Causing my eyes to see;
Jesus makes beautiful
Things of my life.
