I will sing of the mercies
of the Lord for ever,

| will sing of the

mercies of the Lord.

With my mouth will | make known
Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness,
With my mouth will | make known
Thy faithfulness to all generations.

1 will sing of the mercies
of the Lord forever,
1 will sing, I will sing of
the mercies of the Lord.

Whisper a prayer in the morning,
Whisper a prayer at noon
Whisper a prayer in the evening
To keep your heart in tune.
God answers prayer in the morning
Jesus may come in the morning...

There is joy, joy, joy, joy
Down in my heart (3)
Glory to His Name.

I know the devil does'nt like it
But it's down in my heart
Down in my heart (3)

Glory to His name.

I have the peace that
passeth understanding
Down in my heart (3)

Glory to His name.

Trust in the Lord and don't despair
He is a friend so true;
