Perfect rest to me is promised

In my Father's house above.

When my spirit, clothed immortal,

Wings its flight to realms of day,

This, my song through endless ages

Jesus, led me all the way; way.

1 am Thine, O Lord,

I have heard Thy voice,

And it told Thy love to me;

But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me near...er, nearer,
blessed Lord,

To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer,

nearer, blessed Lord,

To Thyself now glorified.

Consecrate me now to

Thy service, Lord,

By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a
steadfast hope,

And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a

single hour

That before Thy throne | spend,
When | kneel in prayer, and

with Thee, my God,

| commune as friend with friend!

There are depths of love that
I cannot know
Till | cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy that
| may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee.
