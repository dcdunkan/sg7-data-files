the golden sun

Beneath the rosy-tinted west,
My blessed Lord will say,
“Well done!”

And | shall enter into rest.

Some day, till then

I'l watch and wait,

My lamp all timmed and

burning bright,

That when my Saviour

opens the gate,

My soul to Him may take its flight.

Sowing in the morning,
sowing seeds of kindness,
Sowing in the noontide and
the dewy eves;

Waiting for the harvest,

and the time of reaping,
We shall come rejoicing,
bringing in the sheaves.

Bringing in the sheaves,
bringing in the sheaves,
We shall come rejoicing,
bringing in the sheaves;

Sowing in the sunshine,

sowing in the shadows,

Fearing neither clouds nor
winter's chilling breeze;

By and by the harvest, and the
labour ended,

We shall come rejoicing, bringing
in the sheaves!

Go then ever, weeping, sowing for
the Master,

Though the loss sustained out
spirit often grieves;
