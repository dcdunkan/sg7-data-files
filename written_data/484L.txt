In the sweet... “by-and-by”
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

There is cleansing and healing for all
Who will wash in the life-giving blood,
There is life everlasting and joy
At the right hand of God

through the blood.

Even now while we taste of His love,
We are filled with delight at His Name;
But what will it be when above
We shall join in the song

of the Lamb?

57











Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,
God of glory, Lord of love;

Hearts unfold like flow'rs before Thee,
Hail Thee as the sun above.

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness,
Drive the dark of doubt away;
Giver of immortal gladness,

Fill us with the light of day.

All Thy works with joy surround Thee.
Earth and heav'n reflect Thy rays,
Stars and angels sing around Thee,
Centres of unbroken praise;

Field and forest, vale and mountain,
Bloss'ming meadow,

flashing sea,

Chanting bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice in Thee.

Thou art giving and forgiving

Ever blessing, ever blest,

Well spring of the joy of living,
Ocean-depth of happy rest!

Thou the Father, Christ our Brother
All who live in love are Thine:
Teach us how to love each other,
Lift us to the joy divine.
