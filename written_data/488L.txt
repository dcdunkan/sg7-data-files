O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,
And found in Thee alone,

The peace, the joy | sought so long,
The bliss till now unknown.

Now none but Christ can satisfy,
None other name for me:

There's love, and life, and lasting joy,
Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

I sighed for rest and happiness,

| yearned for them, not Thee;

But while | passed my Saviour by,
His love laid hold on me.

I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
But, ah! the waters failed!

E'en as | stooped to drink they'd fled,
And mocked me as | wailed.

The pleasures lost, | sadly mourned,
But never wept for Thee,

Till grace the sightless eyes received,
Thy loveliness to see.

Jesus, | my cross have taken,

All to leave and follow Thee;
Destitute, despised, forsaken,
Thou, from hence, my all shalt be:

Perish every fond ambition,
AllI've sought, and hoped and known;
Yet how rich is my condition,
God and heaven are still my own!

Let the world despise and leave me,
They have left my Saviour, too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me;
Thou art not, like man, untrue;

And while Thou shalt smile upon me,
