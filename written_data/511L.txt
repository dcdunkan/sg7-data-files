I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He my
Hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory
to see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:
He's the Lily of the Valley,
The Bright and Morning Star,
He’s the fairest of
Ten thousand to my soul!
*** Charles W. Fry

What a wonderful change

in my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul for which
Long | have sought,

Since Jesus came into my heart!

Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Floods of joy o’er my soul

like the sea billows roll,

Since Jesus came into my heart.

I have ceased from my
wandering and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart!
And my sins which were many
Are all washed away,

Since Jesus came into my heart!

There's light in the valley of
death now for me,

Since Jesus came into my heart!
And the gates of the City

beyond | can see

Since Jesus came into my heart!

I shall go there to dwell in

that City, | know

Since Jesus came into my heart!
And I'm happy, so happy
