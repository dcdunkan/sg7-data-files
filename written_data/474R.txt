just as free;

For the Spirit has control,
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter
abides with me.

There’s no thirsting for the things
Of the world - they've taken wings;
Long ago | gave them up,

and instantly

All my night was turned to day,

All my burdens rolled away,

Now the Comforter abides with me

32











Oh let, the Son of God enfold you
with His Spirit and His love,

Let Him fill your life and

satisfy your soul

O let Him have the things

that hold you,

And His Spirit like a dove

Will descend upon your life

and make you whole.

Jesus, O Jesus,
Come and fill Your lambs,
Jesus, O Jesus
Come and fill Your lambs.

O come and sing this song

with gladness

As your hearts are filled with joy,
Lift your hands in sweet
surrender to His Name,

O give Him all your tears and sadness,
Give Him all your years of pain,
And you'll enter into life

in Jesus’ Name
