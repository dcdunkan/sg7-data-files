Nigh unto God.

But though | cannot sing,

or tell, or know

The fulness of Thy love,
while here below,

My empty vessel | may freely
bring;

O Thou, who art of love

the living spring,

My vessel fill.

Then fill me, O my Saviour,

with Thy love!

Lead, lead me to the

living fount above:

Thither may |, in simple faith,
draw nigh,

And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee

And when, Lord Jesus,
Thine own face | see,
When at Thy lofty throne

| bow the knee,

Then of Thy love- in all its
breadth and length,

Its height and depth,

its everlasting strength,
My soul shall sing.

Jesus loves me! this | know,
For the Bible tells me so;

Little ones to him belong;

They are weak, but He is strong.

Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes,
Jesus loves me!

Yes, Jesus loves me!
The Bible tells me so!

Jesus loves me! He who died
