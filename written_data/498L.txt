keep me resting,
Keep me resting till the break of day.

My beloved is Mine and | am His
His banner over me is love (3)
His banner over me is love.

He brought me to His
banqueting table

His banner over me is love, (3)
His banner over me is love.

He lifts me up into heavenly places
His banner over me is love, (3)
His banner over me is love.

Happiness is to know the Saviour
Living a life within His favour
Having a change in my behaviour
Happiness is the Lord.
Happiness is a new creation
Jesus and me in close relation
Having a part in His salvation
Happiness is the Lord.

Real joy is mine,

No matter if tear drops start

I found the secret

It's Jesus in my heart.

Happiness is to be forgiven
Living a life that's worth the living,
Taking a trip that leads to heaven
Happiness is the Lord (3)

1 will sing of the
mercies of the Lord
forever, | will sing, | will sing,
