We will rejoice, we will rejoice
And be glad in it, and be glad in it.

This is the day, that the

Lord hath made,

We will rejoice, and be glad in it,
This is the day, this is the day,
That the Lord... hath... made.

Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path,
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet,
And a light unto my path

When | feel afraid,

Think I've lost my way,

Still You're there right beside me,
And nothing will | fear

As long as You are near,

Please be near me to the end.

1 will not forget

Your love for me, and yet,

My heart forever is wandering,

Jesus, be my guide

And hold me to Your side,

And | will love You to the end.
Amy Grant & Michael W. Smith

Jesus is risen, Jesus is risen
Jesus is risen from the dead.

Jesus has conquered sin and death (2)
Jesus has conquered,
Jesus has conquered
