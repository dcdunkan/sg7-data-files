You are beautiful beyond
description,

Too marvelous for words
Too wonderful for
comprehension,

Like nothing ever seen or heard.
Who can grasp

your infinite wisdom?
Who can fathom the
depth of your love?

You are beautiful beyond
description

Majesty enthroned above.

And [ stand, | stand in awe of you
I stand, | stand in awe of you.
Holy God to whom

all praise is due,

I stand in awe of you.
