For me His blood was shed,

A mocking crown so thorny
Was placed upon His head:

| wondered what He saw in me,
To suffer such deep agony.

Iâ€™'m sitting in His presence,

The sunshine of His face,

While with adoring wonder

His blessings | retrace,

It seems as if eternal days

Are far too short to sound His praise.

So, while the hours are passing,

All now is perfect rest;

I'm waiting for the morning,

The brightest and the best,

When He will call us to His side,

To be with Him, His spotless bride.

I must tell Jesus all my trials,

| can not bear these

burdens alone;

In my distress He kindly will help me,
He ever loves and cares for His own.

1 must tell Jesus! | must tell Jesus!
| cannot bear my burdens alone;
I must tell Jesus! | must tell Jesus!
Jesus can help me, Jesus alone.

Must tell Jesus all of my troubles
He is a kind, compassionate Friend;
If I but ask Him, He will deliver
Make of my troubles quickly

and end | must tell

Tempted and tried, | need

a great Saviour,

One who can help my burdens to bear;
| must tell Jesus, | must tell Jesus
He all my cares and sorrows

will share | must tell
