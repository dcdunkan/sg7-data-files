Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,

In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth

Over sin, and death, and hell.

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be.

King of my life, | crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;

Lest | forget Thy thomn crowned brow,
Lead me to Calvary.

Lest | forget Gethsemane,
Lest | forget Thine agony,
Lest | forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where

Thou wast laid,

Tenderly mourned and wept;
Angels in robes of light arrayed,
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me like Mary through the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee;

Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May | be willing, Lord to bear
Daily my cross for Thee;

Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.
