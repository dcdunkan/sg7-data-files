My glory all the Cross.
*** Elizebeth C. Clephane

When peace like a river
attendeth my way,

When sorrows like sea billows roll,
Whatever my lot, Thou hast
taught me to say,

“It is well, it is well with my soull”

Itis well... with my soul...
It is well, it is well with my soul!

Though Satan should buffet,
though trials should come,

Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded

My helpless estate, and hath
Shed His own blood for my soul.
My sin - oh, the bliss

of this glorious thought -

My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to His cross,

and | bear it no more!

Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord,
O my soul!

And, Lord, haste the day
when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound,
and the Lord shall descend!
Even so it is well with my soul!

Jesus! the very tho't of Thee
With sweetness fills my breast;
But better far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.

No vioce can sing, no heart can frame,
