Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
“As thy days, thy strength

shall be in measure,”

This the pledge to me He made.

Help me then in ev'ry tribulation
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That | lose not faith’s
sweet consolation,
Offered me within Thy holy Word,
Help me, Lord, when toil and
trouble meeting,
E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
One by one, the days,
the moments fleeting
Till | reach the promised land.

*** Lina Sandell Berg

I'm rejoicing night and day

As | walk the pilgrim way

For the hand of God in all my life | see
And the reason of my bliss,

Yes, the secret all is this;

That the Comforter abides with me.

He abides....He abides.....
Hallelujah, He abides with me
I'm rejoicing night and day

As | walk the narrow way,

That the Comforter abides with me.

Once my heart was full of sin,
Once | had no peace within,

Till I heard how Jesus

died upon the tree,

Then | fell down at His feet,

And there came a peace so sweet,
Now the Comforter abides with me.

He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care,
I'm as happy as a bird and
