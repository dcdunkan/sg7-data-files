And it is our love,

rising from our hearts,
Everything within us cries,
“Abba, Father”

Help us now to give You,
With pleasure and delight,
Hearts and minds and wills
That say “I love You, Lord!"

Jehovah Jireh, my Provider,
His grace is sufficient for me,
For me, for me,

Jehovah Jireh, my provider,
His grace is sufficient for me.

My God shall supply all my needs
According to His riches in glory
He shall give His angles

charge over me

Jehovah Jireh cares for me,

for me, for me

Jehovah Jireh cares for me.

Rejoice in the Lord always,
And again | say, rejoice! (2)
Rejoice! Rejoice!
And again | say, rejoice! (2)

As the deer panteth for the water,
so my soul longeth after Thee,
You alone are my heart's desire
And | long to worship Thee.

You alone are my Strength, my Shield
To you alone may my spirit yield.
You alone are my heart’s desire
