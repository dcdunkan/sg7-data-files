Made for the glory of God,
Purchased by His precious Son,
Born with the right to be clean,
For Jesus the victory is won.

We are the family of God,

We are the promise divine,

We are the God's chosen people,
We are the glorious new vine.
Our prayer is to help us to preach you
our prayer is to guard us in faith
We pray for God's chosen people
That is our song of prayer

Let Thy blessing fall on me

Yes, do we hear the voice of Lord

Saying whom shall | send for

Here am | and send me Father.
e Bob Gillman

When | look into Your holiness,

When | gaze into Your loveliness,
When all things that sorround me
become shadows in the light of You

1 worship you, | worship You;
The reson | live is to worship You.
I worship you..I worship You;
The reson | live is to worship You

When I've found the joy of

reaching Your heart,

When my will becomes

enthroned in Your love,

When all things that surround me

become shadows in the light of You
*** Wayne & Cathy Perrin

This is the day, this is the day,
that the Lord hath made,
that the Lord hath made,
