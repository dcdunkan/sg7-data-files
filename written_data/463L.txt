O Lord my God!

When | in awesome wonder
Consider all the works

Thy hand hath made,

| see the stars,

| hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout

The universe displayed.

Then sings my soul,

My Saviour God to Thee;
How great Thou art!
How great Thou art! (2)

When through the woods,
And forest glades | wander,
And hear the birds

Sing sweetly in the trees;
When | look down,

From lofty mountain grandeur,
And hear the brook

And feel the gentle breeze.

And when | think;

That God His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die

| scarce can take it in;

That on the cross

My burden gladly bearing,

He bled and died

To take away my sin.

When Christ shall come,
With shout of acclamation,
And take me home

What joy shall fill my heart.
Then shall | bow
