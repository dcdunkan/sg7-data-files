Out of my stony grieves
Bethel I'll raise;

So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee.

Or if on joyful wing

Cleaving the sky,

Sun, moon and stars forgot,
Upwards | fly;

Still all my songs shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer to Thee.

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee;

Let the water and the blood,

From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

Not the labours, of my hands

Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,

All for sin could not atone;

Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand | bring,
Simply to Thy cross | cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress,
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, | to the mountain fly,

Wash me, Saviour or | die!

While | draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death
When | soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgement throne
