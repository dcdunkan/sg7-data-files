We'll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all.

My redeemer, Oh what beauties
In that lovely Name appear,
None but Jesus, in His glories,
Shall the honoured title wear.
My Redeemer; my Redeemer,
Thou hast my salvation wrought.

Sunk in ruin, sin, and misery,
Bound by satanâ€™s captive chain,
Guided by his artful treachery,
Hurrying on to endless pain;

My Redeemer, my Redeemer,
Plucked me as a brand from hell.

Mine by covenant, mine for ever,
Mine by oath, and mine by blood,
Mine, nor time the bond shall sever.
Mine as an unchanging God.

My Redeemer, my Redeemer,
Oh, how sweet to call Thee mine!

When in heaven | see Thy glory,
When before Thy throne | bow,
Perfected | shall be like Thee,
Fully Thy redemption know.

My Redeemer, my Redeemer,
Then shall hear me shout

His praise.

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,
With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
