| will make you fishers of men
If you follow Me, If you follow Me,
| will make you fishers of men
If you follow Me.

Hear Christ calling, come unto Me,
Come unto Me, come unto Me
Hear Christ calling, come unto Me,
I will give you rest, | will give you rest,
| will give you rest,

Hear Christ calling, “Come unto Me
1 will give you rest.”

I've got a home in glory land
That outshines the sun,

I've got a home in glory land
That outshines the sun,

I've got a home in glory land
That outshines the sun,
Way beyond the blue.

Do Lord, O, do Lord,

Oh do remember me,

Do Lord, O, do Lord,

Oh, do remember me; (2)
Way beyond the blue.

I took, Jesus as my Saviour,
You take Him, too.
