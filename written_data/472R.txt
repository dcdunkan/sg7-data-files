The Spirit and the bride say, “come”
Heaven is in my heart.
*** Graham Kendrick

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
| dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

On Christ, the solid Rock, | stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness veils His lovely face,
| rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,

My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

When He shall come with

trumpet sound,

Oh, may | then in Him be found;

Dressed in His righteousness alone,

Faultless to stand before the throne.
e Edward Mote

All to Jesus | surrender,

All to Him | freely give;

| would ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.

1 surrender all, | surrender all;
All to Thee my blessed Saviour,
| surrender all

All to Jesus | surrender,

Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;
May Thy Holy Spirit fill me,

May | know Thy pow'r Divine.
