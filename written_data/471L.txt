Summer and winter, and
spring time and harvest
Sun, moon and stars in their
courses above,

Join with all nature in
manifold witness

To Thy great faithfulness,
mercy and love.

Pardon for sin and a
peace that endureth,
Thy own dear presence to
cheer and to guide;
Strength for to-day and bright
hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine
with ten thousand beside!
*** Thomas O. Chisholm

22











Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;

While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Saviour, Saviour,

hear my humble cry;

While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;

Kneeling there in deep contrition
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit

Would | seek Thy face;

Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,
Whom have | on earth beside Thee?
