My sins were washed away,
And my night was turned to day,
Heaven came down and glory
filled my soul!

Born of the spirit with life from above,
Into God's family divine,

Justified fully throâ€™ Calvary's love,
Oh what a standing is mine!

And the transaction so quickly
was made

When as a sinner | came,

Took of the offer of grace He did proffer,
He saved me,O praise

His dear name!

Now I've a hope that will
surely endure,
After the passing of time;
I have a future in heaven for sure,
There in those mansions sublime
And it's because of that
wonderful day,
When at the cross | believed;
Riches eternal and blessings
supernal
From His precious hand
I received.

Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us
O'er the world's tempestuous sea;
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,
For we have no help but Thee;
Yet possessing every blessing,

If our God our Father be.

Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us;
All our weakness Thou dost know;
Thou didst tread this earth before us,
Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
