And He can well secure
What I've committed to His hands,
Till the decisive hour.

Then will He own my worthless name
Before His Father’s face;

And, in the New Jerusalem,
Appoint my soul a place.

Standing on the promises

of Christ my King,

Through eternal ages

let His praises ring;

Glory in the highest,

I will shout and sing,

Standing on the promises of God.

Stand...ing..,. Stand...ing...,
Standing on the promises of
God my Saviour;

Stand...ing..., Stand...ing....,

I'm standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises

that cannot fail,

When the howling storms of
doubt and fear assail,

By the living word of God

| shall prevail,

Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises of
Christ the Lord,

Bound to Him eternally by

love’s strong cord,

Overcoming daily with

the Spirit's sword,

Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises | cannot fall,
Listening every moment
to the Spirit's call,
