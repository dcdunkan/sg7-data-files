and [ long to worship Thee.

You're my friend and You are my brother
Even though You are a King,

| love you more than any other,

So much more than anything.

I want You more than gold or silver,
Only You can satisfy.
You alone are the real joy-giver,
And the apple of mine eye.
b Martin Nystrem

Give thanks with a grateful heart
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's given
Jesus Christ, His Son (2)

And now let the weak say,
“I am strong”

Let the poor say “I am rich”
Because of what the Lord
has done for us!”

And now let the sick say,

“I am healed”

Let the poor say “I am rich”
Because of what the Lord
has done for us!” (2)

Give thanks

Wide wide as the ocean,

High as the heaven above,
Deep deep as the deepest sea.
Is my Saviour's love.

I though so unworthy,

Still I'am a child of His care,
For His Word teaches me,
That His love reaches me
Everywhere.
