Thy glory may not see,

Only Thou art holy,

There is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power,

in love, and purity.

Holy, Holy, Holy!

Lord God Almighty!

All Thy works shall praise
Thy Name, in earth,

and sky, and sea.

Holy, Holy, Holy!

Merciful and mighty!

God in Three Persons,
blessed Trinity!

Reginald Heber
38











There's not a friend like
the lowly Jesus,

No, not one! no, not one!
None else could heal
all our soul's diseases,
No, not one! no, not one!

Jesus knows all about our struggles,
He will guide till the day is done;
Thereâ€™s not a friend like the lowly Jesus
No, not one! no, not one!

No friend like Him is so high and holy,
No, not one! no not one!
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly,
No not one! no, not one!

There's not an hour that
He is not near us,

No, not one! no, not one!
No night so dark but

His love can cheer us,
No, not one! no, not one!

Did ever saint find
this Friend forsake him?
