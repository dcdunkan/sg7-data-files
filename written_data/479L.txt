Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!,

O, come to the Father,

through Jesus the Son,

And give Him the glory,

Great things He hath done.

O perfect redemption,

the purchase of blood,

To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus

a pardon receives....

Great things He hath taught us,
Great things He hath done
And great our rejoicing thro
Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and
greater will be
Our wonder, our transport,
when Jesus we see...

All hail the power of

Jesus’ name!

Let angles prostrate fall,
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all!

Ye saints redeemed of

Adam’s race;

Ye ransomed from the fall.

Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Let every kindred, every tribe
On this terrestrial ball,

To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.

©Oh, that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall,
