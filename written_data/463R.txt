'HYMNS

In humble adoration,
And there proclaim
My God how great Thou art!
*** Carl Boberg

He is my everything He is my all,
He is my everything
Both great and small,
He gave Himself for me
Made everything new
He is my everything
Now how about you?
Like honey in the rock
Sweet honey in the rock
For He tastes like
honey in the rock

O taste and see that
the Lord is good

For He tastes like
honey in the rock.

Some folks may ask me,
some folks may say
Who is this Jesus

You talk about every day?
He is my Saviour

And He set me free

Now listen while | tell you
What He means to me.

Amazing grace!

How sweet the sound,

That saved a wretch like me!

| once was lost, but now am found
