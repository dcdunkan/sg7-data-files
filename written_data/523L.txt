‘Tis Thou who art worthy,
Lord Jesus, ‘tis Thou!

I would love Thee in life,

I would love Thee in death,

And praise Thee as long as
Thou lendest me breath,

And sing, should the death-dew
lie cold on my brow,

‘Tis Thou who art worthy,

Lord Jesus, ‘tis Thou!

And when the bright morn of
Thy glory shall come,

And the children ascend to the
Father's glad home,

I'll shout, with Thy likeness
impressed on my brow,

‘Tis Thou who art worthy,

Lord Jesus, ‘tis Thou!

Make my life to be like a melody,
Ever sounding out of the
message of the Cross;

Saviour let me be, like a melody,
Ever sounding out in days of
gain or loss.

With Jesus in your heart, no
discord can arise,

He can make the saddest heart
to harmonise!

Saviour let me be like a melody,
Ever sounding out the message
of the Cross.

My Jesus! My Saviour!
Lord, there is none like you,
All of my days, | want to praise,
