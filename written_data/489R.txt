Resting in my Saviour as my alkn-all,
Standing on the promises of God.
e R. Kelso Carter

O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,

Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home!

Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.

Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

A thousand ages in Thy sight,
Are like an evening gone;

Short as the watch that ends the night,
Before the rising sun.

O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,

Be Thou our guide while life shall last,
And our eternal home.

Isaac Watts

He leadeth me, O blessed tho't!
Oh, words with heavenly

comfort fraught!

Whate'er | do, where'er | be,

Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me!

He leadeth me, He leadeth me,
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower | would be;
For by His hand He leadeth me!

Sometimes 'mid scenes of
deepest gloom,
