but thine the cleansing blood;
Here is my robe, my refuge,
and my peace -

Thy blood, Thy righteousness,
O Lord, my God.

Feast after feast thus comes
and passes by,

Yet passing, points to that

glad feast above;

Giving sweet foretaste of the
festal joy,

The Lamb'’s great bridal-feast of
bliss and love.
