Like walking in His will,
For me to live is Christ
to die is gain.
Now once my heart was
full of sin and shame,
Till someone told me
Jesus came to save,
When He said,
“Come home” to me
He set my poor heart free,
For me to live is Christ
to die is gain.
Now there are things that
I still do not know,
But of this one thing
I'm completely sure,
He who called me on that day
Washed all my sins away,
For me to live is Christ,
to die is gain.

o J White

God forgave my sin in
Jesus’ name,

I've been born again in
Jesus’ name;

And in Jesus’ name

| come to you,

To share His love as
He told me to.

He said: ‘Freely, freely,
you have received,

Freely, freely give;

Go in My name, and
because you believe,
Others will know that I live.’

All power is given in Jesus’ name,
In earth and heaven in
Jesus’ name;
