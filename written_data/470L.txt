More about Jesus, on His throne,

Riches in glory all His own;

More of His kingdom's sure increase,

More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

(Psalms 23)

The Lord’s my Shepherd,

I shall not want;

He makes me down to lie

In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of
righteousness,

E'en for His own name’s sake.

Yea, though | walk through
death’s dark vale,

Yet will | fear no ill;

For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnished

In presence of my foes;

My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;
And in God’s house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.

***  Scottish Psalter

20











“Fear not, | am with Thee”;
Blessed golden ray,

Like a star of glory,

Lighting up my way!

Through the clouds of midnight
This bright promise shone.
