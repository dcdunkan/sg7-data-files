â€œYe that are men, now serve Him"
Against unnumbered foes;

Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
Stand in his strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you,
Ye dare not trust your own:
Put on the gospel armour,
Each piece put on with prayer;
Where duty calls or danger,
Be never wanting there.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor's song:
To him that overcometh,
A crown of life shall be:
He with the King of glory,
Shall reign eternally.

Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,
Much we need Thy tender care;

In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use Thy folds prepare:
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us, Thine we are (2)

We are Thine; do Thou befriend us,
Be the Guardian of our way;

Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,
Seek us when we go astray:
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Hear, Oh hear us when we pray (2)

Thou hast promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful though we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
Grace to cleanse, and power to free:
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
