No, not one! no, not one!

Or sinner find that He would
not take him?

No, not one! no, not one!

Was e'er a gift like the Saviour given?
No, not one! no, not one!
Will He refuse us a home in heaven
No, not one! no, not one!

God sent His son,

They called Him Jesus,

He came to love, heal and forgive;
He lived and died to buy by pardon,
An empty grave is there

To prove my Saviour lives.

Because He lives | can face tomorrow,
Because He lives all fear is gone;
Because | know He holds the future,
And life is worth the living

Just because He lives.

How sweet to hold a new bom baby,
And feel the pride and joy He gives;
But greater still the calm assurance,
This child can face uncertain days
Because He lives.

And then one day, I'll cross the river
I'll fight lifeâ€™s final war with pain;
And then as death gives way to victry,
I'll see the lights of glory

And I'll know He lives.

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven,
To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Who like me, His praise should sing?
Praise Him, Praise Him
