And wonders, wonders of His love.

What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole gain?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Oh! precious is the flow

That makes me white as snow;
No other fount | know,

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my pardon this | see -

Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
For my cleansing this my plea -
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone -
Nothing but the blood of Jesus,
Naught of good that | have done-
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace -
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness -

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Jesus, lover of my soul,

Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide,
Oh, receive my soul at last.

Other refuge have I none,

Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me!
