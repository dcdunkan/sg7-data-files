Have Thine own way, Lord!

Have Thine own way!

Thou art the potter, | am the clay.
Mould me and make me after Thy will,
While | am waiting, yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord!

Have Thine own way!

Search me and try me, Master today
Whiter than snow, Lord,

Wash me just now,

As in Thy presence humbly | bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord!

Have Thine own way!

Wounded and weary, help me, | pray
Power, all power surely is Thine
Touch me and heal me, Saviour divine!

Have Thine own way, Lord!

Have Thine own way!

Hold oâ€™er my being, absolute sway!

Fill with Thy Spirit

Till all shall see

Christ only, always living in me!
*** Adelaide A. Pollard
