May my will forever be
Evermore Your own

Never let my heart grow cold,
Never let me go.

Abba, Father let me be
Evermore Your own.

Jesus, name above all names,
Beautiful Saviour, Glorious Lord!
Emmanuel, God is with us,
Blessed Redeemer, Living Word.

I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy,

Down in my heart... Where?
Down in my heart... Where?
Down in my heart.

I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy

Down in my heart.. glory to His name.
I've got the peace that

passeth understanding...

| hear the Spirit crying ‘Abba, Father’
| know the Father, Son and
Spirit's living...

Alive, alive, alive for evermore
My Jesus is alive,

alive for evermore (2)

Sing Hallelujah, Sing Hallelujah,
My Jesus is alive for evermore
Sing Hallelujah, Sing Hallelujah
My Jesus is alive.
