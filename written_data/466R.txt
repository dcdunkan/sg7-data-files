Everything to God in prayer!

Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
Oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?

We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in prayer!

Are we weak and heavy-laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge -
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.

***  Joseph Scriven

10











When the trumpet of the Lord
shall sound,and time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks,
eternal, bright, and fair;

When the saved of earth shall gather
Over on the other shore,

And the roll is called up yonder;
Il be there

When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder,
I'll be there.

On that bright and cloudless moming
When the dead in Christ shall rise,
