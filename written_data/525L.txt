He brings a poor vile sinner into
His “house of wine.”

| stand upon His merit—I know

no other stand,

Not e’'en where glory dwelleth in
Immanuel’s land.

The Bride eyes not her garment,
but her dear Bridegroom’s face;

I will not gaze at glory, but on my
King of grace.

Not at the crown He giveth, but on
His pierced hand;

The Lamb is all the glory, of
Immanuel’s land.

212











Therefore the redeemed of the
Lord shall return,

And come with singing unto Zion,
And everlasting joy shall be upon
their heads -2

They shall obtain gladness
and joy,

And sorrow and mourning
shall flee away

Therefore the redeemed of the
Lord shall return,

And come with singing unto Zion,
And everlasting joy shall be upon
their heads

213











There's a land

that is fairer than day,

And by faith we can see it afar,
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a

dwelling place there.
