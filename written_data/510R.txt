Find Him wholly true.
***  France R. Havergal

159











I've found a Friend in Jesus,
He's everything to me;

He's the fairest of

Ten thousand to my Soul!
The “Lily of the Valley”,

In Him alone | see -

All | need to cleanse and
make me fully whole.

In sorrow He's my comfort,

In trouble He's my stay;

He tells me every care on Him to roll:
He’s the Lily of the Valley,

the Bright and Morning Star,

He’s the fairest of

Ten thousand to my soul.

He all my grief has taken,
And all my sorrows borne;

In temptation He's my strong
And mighty tower;

He has all my sin forgiven,
And Him | do adore

From my heart, and now

He keeps me by His power,
Though all the world forsake me,
And Satan tempt me sore,
Through Jesus | shall safely
Reach the goal.

He's the Lily of the Valley,
The Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of

Ten thousand to my soul!

He'll never, never leave me
Nor yet forsake me here,
While | live by faith,

And seek His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me,
