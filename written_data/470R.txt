“I' will never leave thee

Never will leave thee alone”

No never alone; No never alone
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

Roses fade around me
Lilies bloom and die
Earthly sunbeams vanish
Radiant still the sky!
Jesus, Rose of Sharon,
Blooming for His own
Jesus, heaven's sunshine
Never will leave me alone.

Steps unseen before me,
Hidden dangers near,
Nearer still my Saviour,
Whispering, “Be of cheer.”
Joys, like birds of springtime
To my heart have flown,
Singing all so sweetly

“He will not leave me alone.”

21











Great is Thy faithfulness,

O God my Father,

There is no shadow of turning
with Thee;

Thou changest not

Thy compassions, they fail not;
As Thou hast been

Thou forever wilt be

Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning
new mercies | see;

All I have needed

Thy hand hath provided -
Great is Thy faithfulness,
Lord, unto me!
