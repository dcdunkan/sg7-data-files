On the cross! On the Cross!
To heav'n He turns
triumphant eyes:

“Tis finished” now,

the conqueror cries,

Then bows His sacred
head and dies,

On the cross! On the Cross!

But now He's ris'n,
ascended, crowned,
On the throne! On the throne!
Heaven's highest place
for Him is found,
On the throne! On the throne!
Our hearts we low in worship bow,
And join, as one, to hail Him now:
“Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou!”
On the throne! On the throne!

Holy, Holy, Holy!

Lord God Almighty!

Early in the morning

our song shall rise to Thee:
Holy, Holy, Holy,

Merciful and Mighty!

God in Three Persons,
blessed Trinity!

Holy, Holy, Holy!

All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden
crowns around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim
falling down before Thee,
Which wert, and art, and
evermore shalt be.

Holy, Holy, Holy!
Tho' the darkness hide Thee
Tho' the eye of sinful man
