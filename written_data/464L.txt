Was blind, but now | see

’T was grace that

taught my heart to fear,

And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that
grace appear

The hour | first believed!

Through many dangers,

Toils and snares

| have already come:

‘Tis grace that brought me
safe thus far,

And grace will lead me home.

When we've been there
ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to
sing God'’s praise
Than when we first begun.
e John Newton

Have you been to Jesus
for the cleansing power?
Are you washed in the
blood of the Lamb?

Are you fully trusting in
His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the
blood of the Lamb?

Are you washed in the blood,
In the soul-cleansing

blood of the Lamb ?

Are your garments spotless?
Are they white as snow?

Are you washed in the

blood of the Lamb?

Are you walking daily by the
Saviour's side?
