Name above all names (2)

We believe He sends His Spirit,
On His church with gifts of power,
God, His word of truth affirming,
Sends us to the nations now,
He will come again in glory,
Judge the living and the dead.
Every knee shall bow before Him,
Then must every tongue confess.

When He rolls up His sleeves
He ain't just putting on the ritz
Our God is an awesome God
There’s thunder in His footsteps
And lightning in His fists

Our God is an awesome God
The Lord wasn't joking

When He kicked ‘em out of Eden
And it wasn't for no reason

That He shed His blood

His return is very close

And so you better be believing
that

Our God is an awesome God

Our God is an awesome God
He reigns from Heaven above
With wisdom, power, and love
Our God is an awesome God

And when the sky was starless
In the void of the night

Our God is an awesome God
He spoke into the darkness
And created the light

Our God is an awesome God
Judgment and wrath

He poured out on the Sodom
Mercy and grace

He gave us at the cross
