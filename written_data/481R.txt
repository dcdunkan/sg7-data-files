'Tis a haven of heavens to me;
And it lits me up to glory,
For it lifts me up to Thee.

*** 8. Trevor Francis

The love that Jesus had for me,
To suffer on the cruel tree,

That | a ransomed soul might be
Is more than tongue can telll...

His love is more than

tongue can telll... (2)

The love that Jesus had for me
Is more than tongue can tell!

The bitter sorrow that He bore,
And oh that crown of thorns He wore,
That | might live for evermore,

Is more than tongue can tell!

The peace | have in Him, my Lord,
Who pleads before the throne of God
The merit of His precious blood,
Is more than tongue can tell!

The joy that comes when

He is near,

The rest He gives, so free from fear,
The hope in Him, so bright and dear,
Is more than tongue can tell!

How sweet the Name of

Jesus sounds in a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows,

heals his wounds,

And drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole
And calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.
