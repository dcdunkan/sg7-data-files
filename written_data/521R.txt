Heaven's gate to open wide:
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.

Jesus loves me! Loves me still,
When I'm very weak and ill:

From His shining throne on high
Comes to watch me where | lie.

Jesus loves me! He will stay
Close beside me all the way:
If I love Him, when | die

He will take me home on high.

Jesus, our Lord,

with what joy we adore Thee,
Chanting our praise to
Thyself on the throne!

Blest in Thy presence,

we worship before Thee,
Own Thou art worthy,

and worthy alone.

Lord, Thou art worthy, Lord,
Thou art worthy;

Lord, Thou art worthy,

and worthy alone!

Blest in Thy presence

we worship before Thee,
Own Thou art worthy,

and worthy alone!

Verily God, yet be

come truly human,

Lower than angels

to die in our stead;

How hast thou, long promised
“Seed of the woman”,

Trod on the serpent and
bruised his head!

How didst Thou humble
