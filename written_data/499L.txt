No matter what your troubles are
Jesus will see you through,

Sing when the day is bright
Sing through the darkest night;
Every day, all the way

Let us sing, sing, sing.

Everybody ought to know (2)
Everybody ought to know Who Jesus is
He's the lily of the Valley

He's the bright and Morning Star
Heâ€™s the fairest of ten thousand
Everybody ought to know.

Everybody ought to tell (2)
Everybody ought to tell who Jesus is
On the cross He died for sinners
And His blood makes white as snow
Loving, living coming Saviour
He's the one you ought to know.

Rolled away, rolled away,
rolled away,

Every burden of my sin
rolled away

Every sin has to go
Beneath the cleansing flow,
Hallelujah

Rolled away, rolled away,
rolled away

Every burden of my sin
rolled away

He is the same unchanging Jesus,
Unchanging Jesus, unchanging Jesus,
