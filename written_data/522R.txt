King of all days,

So highly exalted,

Glorious in Heaven above,

Humbly You came to the

earth you created,

All for love’s sake became poor

(Here I am...)

I'll never know how much it cost,

To see my sin upon that cross -4
i Tim Hughes

Lord, | lift Your name on high,
Lord, | love to sing Your praises,
I'm so glad, You're in my life,

I'm so glad, You came to save us.

You came from heaven to earth,

To show the way,

From the earth to the cross,

My debt to pay,

From the cross to the grave,

From the grave to the sky,

Lord, 1 lift Your name on high.
e Rick Founds

Lord Jesus, | love Thee,
I know Thou art mine,
My rock and my fortress,
my surety divine;

My gracious Redeemer,
my song shall be now,
‘Tis Thou who art worthy,
Lord Jesus, ‘tis Thou!

I love Thee because

Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon
on Calvary’s tree.

I love Thee for wearing
the thorns on Thy brow;
