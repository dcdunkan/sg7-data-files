Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, “O sinner, come home!”

Why should we tarry when
Jesus is pleading,

Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and
heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting,

the moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering,
death-beds are coming
Coming for you and for me.

Oh for the wonderful love
He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Tho' we have sinned,
He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me.

Just as | am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was

O Lamb of God, | come! | come!

Just as | am, tho’ tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt;
Fightings within, and fears without,
O Lamb of God, | come! | come!

Just as | am, poor, wretched, blind;
