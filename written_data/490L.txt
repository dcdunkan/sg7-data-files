Sometimes where Eden’s
bowers bloom,

By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
Still ‘tis His hand that leadeth me!

Lord, | would clasp Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmer nor repine,
Content, whatever lot | see,

Since 'tis Thy hand that leadeth me.

And when my task on earth is done,
When, by Thy grace, the victory's won,
E’en death’s cold wave | will not flee,
Since God thro’ Jordan leadeth me.

*** Joseph H. Gilmore

Guide us, O Thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrims thro’ this barren land;
We are weak, but Thou art mighty;
Hold us by Thy pow'rful hand
Bread of heaven, Feed us now
and evermore.

Bread of heaven, Feed us now
and evermore

Open wide the living fountain,
Whence the healing waters flow;
Be Thyself our cloudy pillar

Al the dreary desert thro':

Strong deliverer,

Be Thou still our strength

and shield, strong deliverer,

Be Thou still our strength and shield,

While we tread this vale of sorrow,
May we in thy love abide;

Keep us, O our gracious Saviour!
Cleaving closely to Thy side:

Still relying on our Father's
changeless love, Still relying

On our Father's changeless love,

Saviour, come! we long to see Thee,
