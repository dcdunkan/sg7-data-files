SG7 Data files
==============

* The data is not accurate at all. It was read using tesseract-ocr.
* The program is not very structured, or good either.

SG â€” *Sthuthi Geethangal*, is a Malayalam Christian song book. I have been
trying to parse the PDF file into a usable form of data for a very long time
and I finally managed to do that. Leaving the files here.

There is a lot of files in this repository, most of them is not even
necessary, I know that. But I am not filtering them out now.

      tesseract-ocr. some of them are modified using the program.
