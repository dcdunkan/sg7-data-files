{"number":216,"language":"English","text":"To Calvary, Lord, in spirit now,\nOur weary souls repair,\n\nTo dwell upon Thy dying love,\nAnd taste its sweetness there.\n\nSweetresting place of every heart,\n\nThat feels the plague of sin,\nYetknows the deep, mysterious joy\nOf peace with God within.\n\nThere, through Thine hour of\ndeepest woe,\n\nThy suffering spirit passed;\nGrace there its wondrous\nvictory gained,\n\nAnd love endured its last.\n\nO Lamb of God!\n\nThy bleeding wounds,\n\nWith cords of love divine,\nHave drawn\n\nour willing hearts to Thee,\nAnd linked our life with Thine.\n\nOurlonging eyes would fain behold\n\n\nThat bright and blessed brow,\nOnce wrung with bitterest\nanguish, wear\n\nIts crown of glory now.\n\nThy sympathies and hopes are ours:\n\nWe long, O lord, to see\n\nCreation all below, above,\n\nRedeemed and blest by Thee.\n*** Sir Edward Denny"}
