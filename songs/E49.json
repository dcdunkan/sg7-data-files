{"number":49,"language":"English","text":"Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus,\nVast, unmeasured, boundless, free,\nRolling as a mighty ocean\n\nIn its fullness over me.\nUnderneath me, all around me;\nIs the current of Thy love;\n\nLeading onward, leading homeward,\nTo my glorious rest above.\n\n0, the deep, deep love of Jesus,\nSpread His praise from shore to shore,\nHow He loveth, ever loveth,\nChangeth never, never more;\nHow He watches o'er\n\nHis loved ones,\n\nDied to call them all His own;\nHow for them He intercedeth,\nWatcheth o'er them from the throne.\n\n0, the deep, deep love of Jesus,\nLove of every love the best;\n\n'Tis an ocean vast of blessing,\n'Tis a heaven sweet of rest.\n\nO the deep, deep love of Jesus,\n\n\n'Tis a haven of heavens to me;\nAnd it lits me up to glory,\nFor it lifts me up to Thee.\n\n*** 8.
