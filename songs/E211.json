{"number":211,"language":"English","text":"The sands of time are sinking,\nthe dawn of Heaven breaks;\n\nThe summer morn I've sighed\nfor—the fair, sweet morn awakes:\nDark, dark hath been the\nmidnight, but dayspring is at\nhand,\n\nAnd glory, glory dwelleth in\nImmanuel’s land.\n\nO Christ, He is the fountain, the\ndeep, sweet well of love!\n\nThe streams of earth I've tasted,\nmore deep I'll drink above:\nThere, to an ocean fullness, His\nmercy doth expand,\n\nAnd glory, glory dwelleth in\nImmanuel’s land.\n\nOh | am my Beloved's, and my\nBeloved’s mine!\n\n\nHe brings a poor vile sinner into\nHis “house of wine.”\n\n| stand upon His merit—I know\n\nno other stand,\n\nNot e’'en where glory dwelleth in\nImmanuel’s land.\n\nThe Bride eyes not her garment,\nbut her dear Bridegroom’s face;\n\nI will not gaze at glory, but on my\nKing of grace.\n\nNot at the crown He giveth, but on\nHis pierced hand;\n\nThe Lamb is all the glory, of\nImmanuel’s land."}
