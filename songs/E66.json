{"number":66,"language":"English","text":"1 am Thine, O Lord,\n\nI have heard Thy voice,\n\nAnd it told Thy love to me;\n\nBut I long to rise in the arms of faith,\nAnd be closer drawn to Thee.\n\nDraw me near...er, nearer,\nblessed Lord,\n\nTo the cross where Thou hast died;\nDraw me nearer, nearer,\n\nnearer, blessed Lord,\n\nTo Thyself now glorified.\n\nConsecrate me now to\n\nThy service, Lord,\n\nBy the power of grace divine;\nLet my soul look up with a\nsteadfast hope,\n\nAnd my will be lost in Thine.\n\nOh, the pure delight of a\n\nsingle hour\n\nThat before Thy throne | spend,\nWhen | kneel in prayer, and\n\nwith Thee, my God,\n\n| commune as friend with friend!\n\nThere are depths of love that\nI cannot know\nTill | cross the narrow sea;\nThere are heights of joy that\n| may not reach\nTill I rest in peace with Thee.\n*** Fanny J.
