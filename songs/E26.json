{"number":26,"language":"English","text":"My hope is built on nothing less\nThan Jesus' blood and righteousness;\n| dare not trust the sweetest frame,\nBut wholly lean on Jesus' name.\n\nOn Christ, the solid Rock, | stand;\nAll other ground is sinking sand,\nAll other ground is sinking sand.\n\nWhen darkness veils His lovely face,\n| rest on His unchanging grace;\nIn every high and stormy gale,\n\nMy anchor holds within the veil.\n\nHis oath, His covenant, His blood\nSupport me in the whelming flood;\nWhen all around my soul gives way\nHe then is all my hope and stay\n\nWhen He shall come with\n\ntrumpet sound,\n\nOh, may | then in Him be found;\n\nDressed in His righteousness alone,\n\nFaultless to stand before the throne.\ne Edward Mote"}
