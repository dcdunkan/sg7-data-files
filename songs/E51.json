{"number":51,"language":"English","text":"How sweet the Name of\n\nJesus sounds in a believer's ear!\nIt soothes his sorrows,\n\nheals his wounds,\n\nAnd drives away his fear.\n\nIt makes the wounded spirit whole\nAnd calms the troubled breast;\n'Tis manna to the hungry soul,\nAnd to the weary rest.\n\n\nDear Name! the rock on\nwhich we build,\n\nOur shield and hiding-place;\nOur never-failing treasury,\nfilled With boundless\n\nstores of grace.\n\nJesus! our Saviour,\n\nShepherd, Friend;\n\nOur Prophet, Priest, and King;\nOur Lord, our Life,our Way, our End;\nAccept the praise we bring.\n\nWeak is the effort of our heart,\nAnd cold our warmest thought;\nBut when we see Thee as Thou art,\nWe'll praise Thee as we ought.\n\nTill then, we would Thy love proclaim\n\nWith every fleeting breath;\n\nAnd triumph, that blessed name\n\nWhich quells the pow'r of death.\n***  John Newton"}
