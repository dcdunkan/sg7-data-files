(3)\nAnd ssinners plunged beneath that blood\n\nE’er since by faith | saw the stream\nThy flowing wounds supply,\nRedeeming love has been my theme,\nAnd shall be till | die (3)\nRedeeming love has been my theme,\n\nThe dying thief rejoiced to see\nThat fountain in his day;\n\nAnd there may I, though vile as he,\nWash all my sins away (3)\n\nAnd there may I, though vile as he,\n\nDear dying Lamb! Thy precious blood\nShall never lose its power, Till all\nthe ransomed Church of God\n\nBe saved to sin no more (3)\n\nTill all the ransomed Church of God\n\nThen, in a nobler, sweeter song,\nI'll sing Thy power to save\nWhen this poor lisping,\nstam’ering tongue\n\nLies silent in the grave (3)\nWhen this poor lisping,\nstam’ering tongue\n\nW.
