{"number":7,"language":"English","text":"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,\n\nLet me hide myself in Thee;\n\nLet the water and the blood,\n\nFrom Thy riven side which flowed,\nBe of sin the double cure,\nCleanse me from its guilt and power.\n\nNot the labours, of my hands\n\nCan fulfill Thy law's demands;\nCould my zeal no respite know,\nCould my tears forever flow,\n\nAll for sin could not atone;\n\nThou must save, and Thou alone.\n\nNothing in my hand | bring,\nSimply to Thy cross | cling;\nNaked, come to Thee for dress,\nHelpless, look to Thee for grace;\nFoul, | to the mountain fly,\n\nWash me, Saviour or | die!\n\nWhile | draw this fleeting breath,\nWhen mine eyes shall close in death\nWhen | soar to worlds unknown,\nSee Thee on Thy judgement throne\n\n\nRock of Ages, cleft for me,\nLet me hide myself in Thee.\n*** Augustus M.
