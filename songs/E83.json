{"number":83,"language":"English","text":"Jesus, keep me near the cross;\nThere a precious fountain,\n\nFree to all, a healing stream,\nFlows from Calv'ry’'s mountain,\n\nIn the Cross, in the Cross,\n\nBe my glory ever;\n\nTill my raptured soul shall find\nRest beyond the river.\n\nNear the Cross, a trembling soul,\nLove and mercy found me;\n\nThere the bright and morning star\nShed its beams around me.\n\nNear the Cross, O Lamb of God,\nBring its scenes before me;\nHelp me walk from day to day\nWith its shadow o’er me.\n\nNear the Cross I'll watch and wait,\nHoping, trusting ever,\n\nTill I reach the golden strand,\nJust beyond the river."}
