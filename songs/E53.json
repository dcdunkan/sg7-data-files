{"number":53,"language":"English","text":"In tenderness He sought me,\nWeary and sick with sin,\n\nAnd on His shoulders\n\nbrought me\n\nBack to His fold again.\n\nWhile angels in His\n\npresence sang,\n\nUntil the courts of heaven rang.\n\nOh, the love that sought me!\nOh, the blood that bought me!\nOh, the grace that brought\nme to the fold,\n\nWondrous grace that brought\nme to the fold!\n\nHe washed the bleeding sin wounds,\nAnd poured in oil and wine;\n\nHe whispered to assure me,\n“I've found thee, thou art Mine!”\n\nI never heard a sweeter voice,\n\nIt made my aching heart rejoice!\n\nHe pointed to the nail-prints,\n\n\nFor me His blood was shed,\n\nA mocking crown so thorny\nWas placed upon His head:\n\n| wondered what He saw in me,\nTo suffer such deep agony.\n\nI’'m sitting in His presence,\n\nThe sunshine of His face,\n\nWhile with adoring wonder\n\nHis blessings | retrace,\n\nIt seems as if eternal days\n\nAre far too short to sound His praise.\n\nSo, while the hours are passing,\n\nAll now is perfect rest;\n\nI'm waiting for the morning,\n\nThe brightest and the best,\n\nWhen He will call us to His side,\n\nTo be with Him, His spotless bride.\n*** W.
