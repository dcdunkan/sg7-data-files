{"number":68,"text":"Jesus, | my cross have taken,\n\nAll to leave and follow Thee;\nDestitute, despised, forsaken,\nThou, from hence, my all shalt be:\n\nPerish every fond ambition,\nAllI've sought, and hoped and known;\nYet how rich is my condition,\nGod and heaven are still my own!\n\nLet the world despise and leave me,\nThey have left my Saviour, too;\nHuman hearts and looks deceive me;\nThou art not, like man, untrue;\n\nAnd while Thou shalt smile upon me,\n\n\nGod of wisdom, love and might,\nFoes may hate, and friends\nmay shun me,\n\nShow Thy face, and all is bright.\n\nMan may trouble and distress me,\n\"T'll but drive me to Thy breast;\n\nLife with trials hard may press me;\nHeaven will bring me sweeter rest.\n\nOh 't's not in grief to harm me,\nWhile Thy love is left to me;\n\nOh 'tere not in joy to charm me,\nWere that joy unmixed with Thee.\n\nHaste thee on from grace to glory,\nArmed by faith and winged by prayer;\nHeaven's eternal dayâ€™s before thee,\nGod's own hand shall guide thee there.\n\nSoon shall close thy earthly mission,\nSwift shall pass thy pilgrim days,\nHope shall change to glad fruition,\nFaith to sight, and prayer to praise.\ni Henry F. Lyte"}
