{"number":5,"text":"Oh happy day that fixed my choice\nOn Thee, my Saviour and my\nGod!\n\nWell may this glowing heart rejoice,\nAnd tell its raptures all abroad.\n\nHappy day, Happy day,\n\nWhen Jesus washed my sins away!\nHe taught me how to watch and pray,\nAnd live rejoicing every day,\nHappy day, happy day,\n\nWhen Jesus washed my sins away!\n*Tis done, the great transactions done\n| am my Lordâ€™s, and He is mine;\nHe drew me and | followed on,\n\n\nCharmed to confess the voice divine.\n\nNow rest my long divided heart;\nFixed on this blissful centre, rest;\nNor ever from Thy Lord depart,\nWith Him of every good possessed.\n\nHigh heaven heard that solemn vow\n\nThat vow renewed shall daily hear,\n\nTill in life's latest hour | bow,\n\nAnd bless in death a bond so dear.\n***  Philip Doddridge"}
