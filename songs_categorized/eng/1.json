{"number":1,"text":"O Lord my God!\n\nWhen | in awesome wonder\nConsider all the works\n\nThy hand hath made,\n\n| see the stars,\n\n| hear the mighty thunder,\nThy power throughout\n\nThe universe displayed.\n\nThen sings my soul,\n\nMy Saviour God to Thee;\nHow great Thou art!\nHow great Thou art! (2)\n\nWhen through the woods,\nAnd forest glades | wander,\nAnd hear the birds\n\nSing sweetly in the trees;\nWhen | look down,\n\nFrom lofty mountain grandeur,\nAnd hear the brook\n\nAnd feel the gentle breeze.\n\nAnd when | think;\n\nThat God His Son not sparing,\nSent Him to die\n\n| scarce can take it in;\n\nThat on the cross\n\nMy burden gladly bearing,\n\nHe bled and died\n\nTo take away my sin.\n\nWhen Christ shall come,\nWith shout of acclamation,\nAnd take me home\n\nWhat joy shall fill my heart.\nThen shall | bow\n\n\n'HYMNS\n\nIn humble adoration,\nAnd there proclaim\nMy God how great Thou art!\n*** Carl Boberg"}
