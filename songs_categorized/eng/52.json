{"number":52,"text":"On a hill far away,\n\nstood an old rugged cross,\nThe emblem of suffering\nand shame\n\nAnd | love that old cross,\nWhere the dearest and blest\nFor a world of lost sinners\nwas slain.\n\nSo I'll cherish the old rugged cross,\nTill my trophies at last I lay down;\n1 will cling to the old rugged cross,\nAnd exchange it some day\n\nfor a crown.\n\nO that old rugged cross,\n\nSo despised by the world,\n\nHas a wondrous attraction for me\nFor the dear Lamb of God,\n\n\nleft His glory above,\nTo bear it to dark Calvary\n\nIn the old rugged cross\nStained with blood so divine,\nA wondrous beauty | see\nFor 't was on that old cross\nJesus suffered and died\n\nTo pardon and sanctify me.\n\nTo the old rugged cross,\n\nI'l ever be true,\n\nIts shame and reproach\n\ngladly bear\n\nThen He'll call me some day,\n\nTo my home far away,\n\nWhere His glory forever I'll share."}
