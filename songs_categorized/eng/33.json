{"number":33,"text":"Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,\nTune my heart to sing Thy grace;\nStream of mercy, never ceasing,\nCall for songs of loudest praise.\nTeach me, Lord, some\n\nrapturous measure,\n\nMeet for blood bought hosts above;\nWhile | sing the countless treasure\nOf my God'â€™s unchanging love.\n\nOh to grace how great a debtor,\nDaily I'm constrained to be!\n\nLet that grace, Lord, like a fetter,\nBind my wandering heart to Thee.\nProne to wander, Lord, | feel it;\nProne to leave the God | love;\n\nYYet Thou, Lord, hast deigned to seal it;\nWith Thy Spirit from above,\n\nJesus sought me when a stranger,\nWandering from the fold of God;\nHe, to save my soul from danger,\nInter-posed His precious blood,\nRescued thus from sin and danger,\nPurchased by the Saviour's blood,\nMay | walk on earth a stranger,\nAs a son and heir of God.\n\n*** Robert Robinson"}
