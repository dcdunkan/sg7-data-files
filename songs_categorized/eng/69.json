{"number":69,"text":"I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,\nOr to defend His cause,\n\nMaintain the honour of his word,\nThe glory of His Cross.\n\nAt the Cross! at the Cross!\nWhere | first saw the light,\n\nAnd the burden of My heart\nrolled away;\n\nIt was there by faith\n\n| received my sight,\n\nAnd now | am happy all the day!\n\nJesus, my God! | know His name,\nHis name is all my trust;\nNor will He put my soul to shame,\nNor let my hope be lost.\n\nFirm as His throne His promise stands,\n\n\nAnd He can well secure\nWhat I've committed to His hands,\nTill the decisive hour.\n\nThen will He own my worthless name\nBefore His Fatherâ€™s face;\n\nAnd, in the New Jerusalem,\nAppoint my soul a place."}
