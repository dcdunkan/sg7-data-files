{"number":29,"text":"Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!\nOh, what a foretaste of glory divine!\n\nHeir of salvation, purchase of God:\nBom of His Spirit, washed in His blood,\n\nThis is my story, this is my song,\n\n\nPraising my Saviour\n\nall the day long\n\nThis is my story, this is my song,\nPraising my Saviour\n\nall the day long..\n\nPerfect submission, perfect delight,\nVisions of rapture now burst on my sight;\nAngels descending, bring from above\nEchoes of mercy, whispers of love\n\nPerfect submission, all is at rest,\nlin my Saviour am happy and blest;\nWatching and waiting,\n\nlooking above,\n\nFilled with His goodness,\n\nlost in His love.\n\nFanny J.
