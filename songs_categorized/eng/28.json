{"number":28,"text":"“There shall be showers of blessing”\nThis is the promise of love;\nThere shall be seasons refreshing,\nSent from the Saviour above.\n\nShowers of blessing,\n\nShowers of blessing we need,\nMercy drops round us are falling,\nBut for the showers we plead.\n\n“There shall be showers of blessing”\nPrecious reviving again;\n\nOver the hills and the valleys,\nSound of abundance of rain.\n\n“There shall be showers of blessing”\nSend them upon us, O Lord;\nGrant to us now a refreshing,\nCome, and now honor Thy Word\n\n“There shall be showers of blessing”\nOh, that today they might fall\nNow as to God we're confessing,\nNow as on Jesus we call!\n\n*** Daniel W. Whittle"}
