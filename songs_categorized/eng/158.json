{"number":158,"text":"Like a river, glorious\n\nIs God's perfect peace,\nOver all victorious\n\nIn its bright increase;\nPerfect, yet it floweth\nFuller every day;\nPerfect, yet it groweth\nDeeper all the way.\n\nHidden in the hollow\nOf His blessed hand,\nNever foe can follow,\nNever traitor stand;\nNot a surge of worry\nNot a shade of care,\nNot a blast of hurry,\nTouch the spirit there.\n\nEvery joy or trial\n\nFalleth from above,\nTraced upon our dial\n\nBy the Son of Love.\n\nWe may trust Him fully\n\nAll for us to do;\n\nThey who trust Him wholly\n\n\nFind Him wholly true.\n***  France R.
