{"number":44,"text":"My redeemer, Oh what beauties\nIn that lovely Name appear,\nNone but Jesus, in His glories,\nShall the honoured title wear.\nMy Redeemer; my Redeemer,\nThou hast my salvation wrought.\n\nSunk in ruin, sin, and misery,\nBound by satanâ€™s captive chain,\nGuided by his artful treachery,\nHurrying on to endless pain;\n\nMy Redeemer, my Redeemer,\nPlucked me as a brand from hell.\n\nMine by covenant, mine for ever,\nMine by oath, and mine by blood,\nMine, nor time the bond shall sever.\nMine as an unchanging God.\n\nMy Redeemer, my Redeemer,\nOh, how sweet to call Thee mine!\n\nWhen in heaven | see Thy glory,\nWhen before Thy throne | bow,\nPerfected | shall be like Thee,\nFully Thy redemption know.\n\nMy Redeemer, my Redeemer,\nThen shall hear me shout\n\nHis praise."}
