{"number":20,"text":"“Fear not, | am with Thee”;\nBlessed golden ray,\n\nLike a star of glory,\n\nLighting up my way!\n\nThrough the clouds of midnight\nThis bright promise shone.\n\n\n“I' will never leave thee\n\nNever will leave thee alone”\n\nNo never alone; No never alone\nHe promised never to leave me,\nNever to leave me alone.\n\nRoses fade around me\nLilies bloom and die\nEarthly sunbeams vanish\nRadiant still the sky!\nJesus, Rose of Sharon,\nBlooming for His own\nJesus, heaven's sunshine\nNever will leave me alone.\n\nSteps unseen before me,\nHidden dangers near,\nNearer still my Saviour,\nWhispering, “Be of cheer.”\nJoys, like birds of springtime\nTo my heart have flown,\nSinging all so sweetly\n\n“He will not leave me alone.”"}
