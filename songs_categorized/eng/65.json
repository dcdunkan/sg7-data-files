{"number":65,"text":"All the way my Saviour leads me:\nWhat have | to ask beside?\n\nCan | doubt His tender mercy,\nWho throâ€™ life has been my Guide?\nHeavenly peace, divinest comfort,\nHere by faith in Him to dwell!\n\nFor | know whate'er befall me,\nJesus doeth all things well; well\n\nAll the way my Saviour leads me:\nCheers each winding path | tread,\nGives me grace for every trial,\nFeeds me with the living bread.\nThough my weary steps may falter,\nAnd my soul athirst may be,\nGushing from the rock before me,\nLo! a spring of joy | see; see.\n\nAll the way my Saviour leads me:\nOh, the fulness of His love!\n\n\nPerfect rest to me is promised\n\nIn my Father's house above.\n\nWhen my spirit, clothed immortal,\n\nWings its flight to realms of day,\n\nThis, my song through endless ages\n\nJesus, led me all the way; way.\nb Fanny J.
