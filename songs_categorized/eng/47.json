{"number":47,"text":"Loved with everlasting love,\nLed by grace that love to know;\nGracious, spirit, from above,\nThou hast taught me it is so!\nOh, this full and perfect peace!\nOh, this transport all divine!\n\nIn a love which cannot cease,\n| am His, and He is mine.\n\nHeaven above is softer blue,\nEarth around is sweeter green!\nSomething lives in every hue\nChristless eyes have never seen:\nBirds with gladder songs o'verflow,\nFlow'rs with deeper\n\nbeauties shine,\n\nSince | know, as now | know,\n\n| am His, and He is mine.\n\nThings that once were\n\nwild alarms\n\nCannot now disturb my rest;\nClosed in everlasting arms,\nPillowed on the loving breast.\nOh, to lie for ever here,\n\nDoubt, and care, and self resign,\nWhile He whispers in my ear,\n\n| am His, and He is mine.\n\nHis for ever, only His;\nWho the Lord and me shall part?\nAh, with what a rest of bliss\nChrist can fill the loving heart!\nHeaven and earth may fade, and flee,\nFirst-born light in gloom decline;\nBut while God and | shall be,\n| am His, and He is mine.\n\n*** George W.
