{"number":19,"text":"(Psalms 23)\n\nThe Lord’s my Shepherd,\n\nI shall not want;\n\nHe makes me down to lie\n\nIn pastures green; He leadeth me\nThe quiet waters by.\n\nMy soul He doth restore again;\nAnd me to walk doth make\nWithin the paths of\nrighteousness,\n\nE'en for His own name’s sake.\n\nYea, though | walk through\ndeath’s dark vale,\n\nYet will | fear no ill;\n\nFor Thou art with me, and Thy rod\nAnd staff me comfort still.\n\nMy table Thou hast furnished\n\nIn presence of my foes;\n\nMy head Thou dost with oil anoint,\nAnd my cup overflows.\n\nGoodness and mercy all my life\nShall surely follow me;\nAnd in God’s house for evermore\nMy dwelling-place shall be.\n\n***  Scottish Psalter"}
