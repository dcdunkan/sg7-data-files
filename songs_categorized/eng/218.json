{"number":218,"text":"We believe in God, the Father\nMaker of the universe,\n\nAnd in Christ, the Son,\n\nour Saviour,\n\nCome to us by virgin birth,\n\nWe believe He died to save us,\nBore our sins, was crucified;\nThen from death,\n\nHe rose victorious,\n\nAscended to the Father's side.\n\nJesus, Lord of all.. Lord of all (4)\n\n\nName above all names (2)\n\nWe believe He sends His Spirit,\nOn His church with gifts of power,\nGod, His word of truth affirming,\nSends us to the nations now,\nHe will come again in glory,\nJudge the living and the dead.\nEvery knee shall bow before Him,\nThen must every tongue confess.\n*** Graham Kendrick"}
