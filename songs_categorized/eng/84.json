{"number":84,"text":"Sweet hour of prayer!\n\nsweet hour of prayer,\n\nThat calls me from a world of care,\nAnd bids me at my Father's throne,\nMake all my wants and wishes known.\nIn seasons of distress and grief\nMy soul has often found relief,\nAnd oft escaped the tempter's snare,\nBy thy return, sweet hour of prayer.\n\nSweet hour of prayer!\nSweet hour of prayer,\n\n\nThe joy | feel, the bliss | share,\n\nOf those whose anxious spirits burn\nWith strong desires for Thy return!\nWith such | hasten to the place\nWhere God, my Saviour, shows His face,\nAnd gladly take my station there,\nAnd wait for thee, sweet\n\nhour of prayer.\n\nSweet hour of prayer!\nsweet hour of prayer,\nThy wings shall my petition bear\nTo Him whose truth\nand faithfulness\nEngage the waiting soul to bless;\nAnd since He bids me\nseek His face,\nBelieve His Word, and\ntrust His grace,\nI'll cast on Him my every care,\nAnd wait for thee, sweet\nhour of prayer.\ne W.
