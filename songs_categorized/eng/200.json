Yes,\nJesus loves me!\n\nYes, Jesus loves me!\nThe Bible tells me so!\n\nJesus loves me! He who died\n\n\nHeaven's gate to open wide:\nHe will wash away my sin,\nLet His little child come in.\n\nJesus loves me! Loves me still,\nWhen I'm very weak and ill:\n\nFrom His shining throne on high\nComes to watch me where | lie.\n\nJesus loves me! He will stay\nClose beside me all the way:\nIf I love Him, when | die\n\nHe will take me home on high."}
