{"number":64,"text":"Oh for a thousand tongues to sing\nMy great Redeemer’s praise,\n\n\nThe glories of my God and King,\nThe triumphs of His grace.\n\nMy gracious Master and my God,\nAssist me to proclaim,\n\nTo spread thro’ all the earth abroad\nThe honors of Thy name.\n\nJesus! the name that charms our fears,\nThat bids our sorrows cease;\n\n'T's music in the sinner’s ears,\n'T's life, and health, and peace.\n\nHe breaks the power of canceled sin,\nHe sets the prisoner free;\nHis blood can make the foulest clean;\nHis blood availed for me.\n\nHear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,\nYour loosened tongues employ;\nYe blind, behold your Saviour come;\nAnd leap, ye lame, for joy.\n\n***  Charles Wesley"}
