{"number":207,"text":"My Jesus! My Saviour!\nLord, there is none like you,\nAll of my days, | want to praise,\n\n\nThe wonders of Your mighty love,\n\nMy comfort, my shelter,\n\nTower of refuge and strength,\nLet every breath, all that | am,\nNever cease to worship You.\n\nShout to the Lord, all the earth, let\nus sing,\nPower and majesty,\npraise to the King,\nMountains bow down and the\nseas will roar,\nAt the sound of your name!\n| sing for joy,\nat the work of your hands,\nForever | love you,\nforever I'll stand,\nNothing compares to the\npromise | have in You.\n***  Zschech Darlene"}
