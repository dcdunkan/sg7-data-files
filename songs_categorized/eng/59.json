{"number":59,"text":"I heard an old, old story,\n\nhow a saviour came from glory,\nHow He gave His life on Calvary\nto save a wretch like me:\n\n| heard about His groaning,\n\nof His precious atoning,\n\nThen | repented of my sins\n\nand won the victory.\n\nO victory in Jesus, my saviour, for ever!\n\n\nHe sought me and brought\nwith His redeeming blood;\nHe loved me ere | knew Him,\nand all my love is due Him\nHe plunged me to victory\nbeneath the cleansing blood.\n\nI heard about His healing,\n\nof His cleansing pow'r revealing,\nHow He made the lame to walk\nagain and caused the blind to see;\nAnd then | cried, “Dear Jesus,\ncome and heal my broken spirit”\nAnd somehow Jesus came and\nbrought to me the victory... O victory\n\nI heard about a mansion\n\nHe has built for me in glory,\n\nAnd | heard about the streets of\ngold beyond the crystal sea;\nAbout the angels singing and\nthe old redemption story,\n\nAnd some sweet day I'll sing up\nthere the song of victory... O victory"}
