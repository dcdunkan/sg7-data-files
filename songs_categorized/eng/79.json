{"number":79,"text":"Beneath the Cross of Jesus,\n| fain would take my stand,\nThe shadow of a mighty rock,\nWithin a weary land:\n\nA home within the wilderness,\nArest upon the way,\n\nFrom the burning\n\nof the noon tide heat,\n\nAnd the burden of the day.\n\nOh, safe and happy shelter,\n\nOh, refuge tried and sweet!\n\nOh, trusting place where heavenâ€™s love\n\nAnd heaven's justice meet!\n\nAs to the holy patriarch\n\nThat wondrous dream was given,\nSo seems my Saviour's Cross to me,\nA ladder up to heaven.\n\nUpon that Cross of Jesus,\n\nMine eye at times can see\n\nThe very dying form of One,\n\nWho suffered there for me;\n\nAnd from my smitten heart, with tears,\nTwo wonders | confess :\n\nThe wonders of His glorious love,\nAnd my own worthlessness.\n\n| take, O Cross, thy shadow\nFor my abiding place;\n\nI ask no other sunshine than\nThe sunshine of His face;\nContent to let the world go by,\nTo know no gain nor loss,\nMy sinful self my only shame,\n\n\nMy glory all the Cross.\n*** Elizebeth C. Clephane"}
