{"number":67,"text":"O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,\nAnd found in Thee alone,\n\nThe peace, the joy | sought so long,\nThe bliss till now unknown.\n\nNow none but Christ can satisfy,\nNone other name for me:\n\nThere's love, and life, and lasting joy,\nLord Jesus, found in Thee.\n\nI sighed for rest and happiness,\n\n| yearned for them, not Thee;\n\nBut while | passed my Saviour by,\nHis love laid hold on me.\n\nI tried the broken cisterns, Lord,\nBut, ah! the waters failed!\n\nE'en as | stooped to drink they'd fled,\nAnd mocked me as | wailed.\n\nThe pleasures lost, | sadly mourned,\nBut never wept for Thee,\n\nTill grace the sightless eyes received,\nThy loveliness to see."}
