{"number":48,"text":"When | survey the wondrous cross,\nOn which the Lord of Glory died,\n\n\nAl earthly gain | count but loss,\nAnd pour contempt on all my pride.\n\nForbid it, Lord, that | should boast,\nSave in the death of Christ, my God,\nAll the vain things that charm me most,\n| sacrifice them to His blood.\n\nSee, from His head, His hands, His feet,\nSorrow and love flow mingled down:\nDid e'er such love and sorrow meet;\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?\n\nWere the whole realm of nature mine,\nThat were an offering far too small;\nLove so amazing, so divine.\nDemands my heart, my life, my all!\ne Isaac Watts"}
