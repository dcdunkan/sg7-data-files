{"number":80,"text":"When peace like a river\nattendeth my way,\n\nWhen sorrows like sea billows roll,\nWhatever my lot, Thou hast\ntaught me to say,\n\n“It is well, it is well with my soull”\n\nItis well... with my soul...\nIt is well, it is well with my soul!\n\nThough Satan should buffet,\nthough trials should come,\n\nLet this blest assurance control,\nThat Christ hath regarded\n\nMy helpless estate, and hath\nShed His own blood for my soul.\nMy sin - oh, the bliss\n\nof this glorious thought -\n\nMy sin, not in part but the whole,\nIs nailed to His cross,\n\nand | bear it no more!\n\nPraise the Lord, Praise the Lord,\nO my soul!\n\nAnd, Lord, haste the day\nwhen the faith shall be sight,\nThe clouds be rolled back as a scroll,\nThe trump shall resound,\nand the Lord shall descend!\nEven so it is well with my soul!\n\n***  Horatio G.
