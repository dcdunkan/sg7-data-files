{"number":10,"text":"When the trumpet of the Lord\nshall sound,and time shall be no more,\nAnd the morning breaks,\neternal, bright, and fair;\n\nWhen the saved of earth shall gather\nOver on the other shore,\n\nAnd the roll is called up yonder;\nIl be there\n\nWhen the roll is called up yonder,\nWhen the roll is called up yonder,\nWhen the roll is called up yonder,\nWhen the roll is called up yonder,\nI'll be there.\n\nOn that bright and cloudless moming\nWhen the dead in Christ shall rise,\n\n\nAnd the glory of His resurrection share;\nWhen His chosen ones shall gather\nto their home beyond the skies,\nAnd the roll is called up yonder;\nI'll be there.\n\nLet us labour for the Master from\nthe dawn till setting sun\nLet us talk of all His\nWondrous love and care,\nThen when all of life is over,\nand Our work on earth is done,\nAnd the roll is called up yonder,\nI'll be there.\n***  James M.
